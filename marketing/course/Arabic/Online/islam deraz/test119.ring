# Functional programming paradigm

/*
	Data --> Don't modify the data in the same location 

	Functions   --> Pass functions as para.
	(First-class)   Return function as value 
			Store in variable
	Recursion -->   Function call itself
			(loops|control structure)
	Lazy Evaluation --> Expressions in function para.
				Evaluated only in usage
