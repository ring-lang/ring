Q: Will AI replace programmers?
===============================

IMHO - NO - NEVER - In reality, in the long-term this will increase the number of programmers required to finish a project.

As we know, to be good at programming, you need to invest many years to have the required skills to build large/complex software. Using AI tools transform the way (How the code is written) - But it transform it to a (SLOW WAY of interaction) and produce code at (LOWER QUALITY) - So when this way becomes the common way to learn about programming and create software because it gives the feeling of (Easy to learn + Save some time at some tasks) - The new generation will not get the required skills to be good at programming, i.e. they will move faster at the beginning then their level will be restricted by the level of these tools.

On the other hand, GREAT PROGRAMMERS who already are very good at programming will become able to use these tools to be more productive (At finding information - Avoid repeating tasks) - But over the time those programmers (May Die or Left the Market - Because as humans we don't stay foreever!) and in this case, when we look at the new generation of programmers, we will not find the same amount of people at this high-level.

To be sure about this, ask yourself, how many programmers are good at low-level system programming (ASM, C/C++, Rust, etc.) compared to high-level programming. 

Also, this scenario assumes that AI tools will be successful and used to the level it becomes the mainstream tools.

Until this section of the post I am talking about the current state of these AI tools. If I am going to talk about the future that we don't know but could try to predict/invent it. The complexity of software and the wide range of possibilities is too much a big problem for AI to solve. Any success in this way will be just in the form of new tools that help programmers, The better tools we have the more we can do, and the customers/competition will ask for more.

In 1980s-1990s - ONE PROGRAMMER could develop a very successful software/game ALONE- because the scope & size of software at this time allows this. and you know what? many of those programmers create everything from scratch (Game Engine, Game Code, etc) - Very GREAT PROGRAMMERS.

In 2024, It's normal to find hundreds/thousands of programmers working on the same software/game. We have many game engines like (Unreal, Unity, etc.) - We have too much easy to learn tools. Does this replace programmers? NO!

So, what you expect when we have better tools?

It's not that these tools will replace programmers, it that these tools will change the scope of software. Nothing can replace programmers, not just because of programming is very hard or complex, but also, because in software the SKY IS THE LIMIT. better tools means more requirements will appears.

Also, the way we interact with AI tools (Chat, Voice, etc.) in natural language have its limits ---> Try to describe a feature in a software like Windows/Linux/macOS and you will know what I mean. To describe the unique thing that you really want in non-ambiguous language ---> THIS IS PART OF PROGRAMMING. and we still have more other parts (Testing, Documentation, Updates, etc.). All of this and we don't talk about responsibility/security part of the software. I know that AI can drive a plane, but if I will travel from my city to another one and heard a voice that says (Welcome, we will start our journey in minute, I am the autopilot) - I WILL LEAVE THIS PLANE IMEDIATLY.

Finally, Thanks to the AI/ML developers who developed nice tools that helped me a lot to write this post.
