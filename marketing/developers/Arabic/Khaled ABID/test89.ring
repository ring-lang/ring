				Prof. Alan Kay (Smalltalk) - GUI
	(1) Communiction between Objects (Only using messages) (fnctn cde)
	(2) Object (Data + Methods) - Separate Data
			[State is the Evil]

	Data 	----> Daughter (you need to protect)
	Methods ----> Parents  (your way to get the Data)

	* Class (Definition) = Attributes (Data) + Methods
		----> Many Objects (Instances)
		[Class Based OOP] --- Java C# C++ Ring Ruby Python

	* Objects (Properties - Values) - Copy Object
		[Prototyped Based OOP] --- Self  -JavaScript

	* Poly. ----> Same Interface (Methods) ---> for Different objcts

		execute() 		---> SQLite
		execute() 		---> MySQL

	* Inhiritance 
		Child ----> Parents 
					Humans
					Employee
					Engineers

					Animals
					Cat	Dog
	
	* composition (Object - Contains other objects)

		Rectangle (2 Objects (Point))
