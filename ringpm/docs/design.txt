========================
Package Manager (RingPM)
========================

Start ---> [Ring Compiler + VM + StdlibCore + RingLibCurl + RingInternet] < 2 Mbyte
	   Without (Libraries|Extensions|Applications)		> 1.1 GByte

Advices
=======

1 - (Start working on Common Cases First - Not General)
2 - (Start with simple methods and simple soltions)
3 - (Don't keep attacking the main problem (Development) )
 	---> After each step - Stop and revise your work first!
		(1) Your next steps will be faster 
		(2) You will Enjoy more!
	Using (ringpm) instead of (ring ringpm.ring) ---> Faster 
	Using different files 	---> More Organization 
				---> Manage Complexity
4 - Testing is important ---> Start writing tests in early stages as possible 
5 - Select good names for (File, Functions, Variables, etc)	
6 - Using (ring filename.ring) is faster for development 
	---> We move from coding to execution (fast)
	But writing the file name is slow
	---> Batch Files is faster 
7 - Before you start programming, Try to be in good mode 
	because most of **hard bugs** is a result of bad mode 
		1 - Social Problem 
		2 - Fixing Bug (While You are not Happy)
		3 - Deadline 
	Good Mode (Happy) ---> Careful - Focus - Better Code 
8 - Ring is designed so we can switch between programming paradigms with little 
	changes to the code 

9 - Be careful when using the Global Variables 
	Updating global variables from many places ---> Increase Complexity

10- Write tests that cover the Use-Cases in details 

How we will know about the installed packages 
=============================================

(1) Get list of "package.ring" files ---> Know installed packages from these files 

	Good 	--> (1) Easy to implement
		    (2) Easy to insert packages 
		    (3) We don't repeat the package information 
	Bad 	--> (1) Depend on folders structures 
		    (2) Folders and Files processing to get the info (Slow?)
				---> Not big problem (We have fast machines)


==================
RingPM Executable		---> DONE
==================

sysargv list ---> Get parameters from the command line 

(1) When we run the app. using ring.exe 

	ring ringpm.ring  <para>
		first para : ring.exe 
		second para : ringpm.ring 
		<our program parameters> 

	ringpm <para> 
		first para : ringpm.exe 
		<our program parameters>

(2) ringpm.exe ----> Will need runtime files 
			ring.dll	---> We can avoid it using -static option in Ring2EXE
			libCurl dlls
	ring/bin folder (Beside the runtime files)

	We have ring/bin in System PATH	

=================================
Adding branch name to the Path?
=================================
	
	(1) Add the branch name to the file System 
		b:\ring\ringpm\local/firstpackage/master/package.ring

	(2) Update Code 	(Better Decision)
		2.1 - Don't add the Master folder to the Path
		2.2 - Use (git command) to change the branch 

			git checkout master 
			git checkout firstpackage-1.1-branch 



===============
Update Command 
===============

ringpm update <package_name>

ringpm update all	---> Update All Packages 

================
Delete Package 
================

ringpm remove <package_name>

	first package 
	second package ---->First Package 
	Third Package  ---->Second Package 

ringpm remove firstpackage ----> Error (Package used by Second Package)
ringpm remove secondpackage ---> Error (Package used by Third Package)
ringpm remove thirdpackage 
		-> Remove (ThirdPackage, SecondPackage, FirstPackage)

[The First Way]
	Get all package.ring files ---> List 
		Package Name , [List Packages that use this package] 
	(N * N) times  ---> How much time for each item? 
		Not very good for performance!

[The Second Way]
	Packages File that we need to update when (Install - Remove - Update)
		Installed Package Name , [List Packages that use this package] 
	
================
Install Package 
================

	ringpm install <package_name>
		
	ringpm install thirdpackage 
			ThirdPackage ---> SecondPackage ---> FirstPackage
			
	Install related packages first, if we have error (cancel operation)		 	

	InstallPackage() ----> ErrorFlag 
		Start ----> ErrorFlag = False 	# NO Error 
		Error ----> ErrorFlag = True	# We have error 
	But we have nested call for InstallPackage()
		We can't use this flag in this simple way

	Two Common Solution
		(1) Check the flag directly after calling installpackage()
			installpackage()
			if ErrorFlag = True return ok
		(2) Use a Counter (ErrorFlag++)
			---> Application (Still Live)
			We don't use this in the Package Manager 
			Because the Package Manager will exit after executing each command
				---> No more operations!


===============
Lock File 
===============

	ringpm install thirdpackage 
		ThirdPackage ---> SecondPackage ---> FirstPackage 

	lock.ring 	for ThirdPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "thirdpackage" , :version = "1.0.0"],
			[:name = "secondpackage", :version = "1.0.1"],
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	lock.ring 	for SecondPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "secondpackage", :version = "1.0.1"],
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	lock.ring 	for FirstPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	(1) Each package add it's information in the start of the lock file

	(2) Each package return it's lock information to caller (Parent Package)

	(3) Each package write the lock file after installation 

=================
Dependency Tree 
=================

					[A]
			[B]				[C]

			[D]				[D]
	(Case 1)	v 1.0				v 1.2	Different Versions.
	(Case 2)	v 1.0				v 1.0   The Same Version

	Lock File 	(Different Version)
			A
			B
			D	v 1.0
			C
			D	v 1.2 

	Lock File 	(Same Version)

			A
			B
			D	v 1.0
			C

=====================
List Command 
=====================

	Goal : (Checking for updates ---> Optional)

	ringpm list -f		---> Don't check updates 

	ringpm fastlist		= (list -f)


==============================================
How to avoid the cPackageURL (Global Variable)
==============================================

	cPackageURL --- { GetPackageFile() , DownloadPackageFiles() }

		GetPackageFile() ---> Define Variable
		DownloadPackageFiles() ---> Use 
			called by GetPackage()

	GetPackage()
			call GetPackageFile() ---> Define Variable
			DownloadPackageFiles() ---> Use 

		Scope ( Local | Object State | Global )

	(1) Keep using Global Variable 
		But Save/Restore cPackageURL in GetPackage()
			---> Just 2 lines of code 

	(2) Use Local Variable 		---> Ignore 
		**** Looks like a Simple Solution ****
			But, We will keep passing cPackageURL many times 
			Or we will return it from the function 
				---> Not good for the API

	(3) Class ---> OBJECT ( Object State )

		We created the InstallCommand Class
