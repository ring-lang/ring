# Win Startup Manager

![WinStartupManager](imgs/WinStartupManager.jpg)

Windows Startup Manager is an application that has the ability to let the user control what programs should start at Windows booting time. It gives you the ability to show, edit, delete, or even add new programs entries to be lunched at Windows booting time.

It is specialized at managing Windows startup entries that are stored in Windows Registry only, but provides a quick option to edit programs shortcuts type entries.

This application has been developed using Ring Programming Language based on RingQt, [Ring_WinCReg](http://ring-wincreg.sf.net/), and [Ring_WINAPI](http://github.com/majdisobain/ring-winapi) extensions.
