FoxRing Library
===============

As a FoxPro developer, I started writing a class with some of the functions I used in FoxPro.

The goal is to create as many functions as possible with the behavior similar to FoxPro functions.

Some of these functions are not yet fully completed, such as frTransform() and frAlines(), however I am updating and making it available.
