========================
Package Manager (RingPM)
========================

Start ---> [Ring Compiler + VM + StdlibCore + RingLibCurl + RingInternet] < 2 Mbyte
	   Without (Libraries|Extensions|Applications)		> 1.1 GByte

=======
Advices
=======

1 - (Start working on Common Cases First - Not General)
2 - (Start with simple methods and simple solutions)
3 - (Don't keep attacking the main problem (Development) )
 	---> After each step - Stop and revise your work first!
		(1) Your next steps will be faster 
		(2) You will Enjoy more!
	Using (ringpm) instead of (ring ringpm.ring) ---> Faster 
	Using different files 	---> More Organization 
				---> Manage Complexity
4 - Testing is important ---> Start writing tests in early stages as possible 
5 - Select good names for (File, Functions, Variables, etc)	
6 - Using (ring filename.ring) is faster for development 
	---> We move from coding to execution (fast)
	But writing the file name is slow
	---> Batch Files is faster 
7 - Before you start programming, Try to be in good mode 
	because most of **hard bugs** is a result of bad mode 
		1 - Social Problem 
		2 - Fixing Bug (While You are not Happy)
		3 - Deadline 
	Good Mode (Happy) ---> Careful - Focus - Better Code 
8 - Ring is designed so we can switch between programming paradigms with little 
	changes to the code 
9 - Be careful when using the Global Variables 
	Updating global variables from many places ---> Increase Complexity
10- Write tests that cover the Use-Cases in details 

=============================================
How we will know about the installed packages 
=============================================

(1) Get list of "package.ring" files ---> Know installed packages from these files 

	Good 	--> (1) Easy to implement
		    (2) Easy to insert packages 
		    (3) We don't repeat the package information 
	Bad 	--> (1) Depend on folders structures 
		    (2) Folders and Files processing to get the info (Slow?)
				---> Not big problem (We have fast machines)


==================
RingPM Executable		---> DONE
==================

sysargv list ---> Get parameters from the command line 

(1) When we run the app. using ring.exe 

	ring ringpm.ring  <para>
		first para : ring.exe 
		second para : ringpm.ring 
		<our program parameters> 

	ringpm <para> 
		first para : ringpm.exe 
		<our program parameters>

(2) ringpm.exe ----> Will need runtime files 
			ring.dll	---> We can avoid it using -static option in Ring2EXE
			libCurl dlls
	ring/bin folder (Beside the runtime files)

	We have ring/bin in System PATH	

=================================
Adding branch name to the Path?
=================================
	
	(1) Add the branch name to the file System 
		b:\ring\ringpm\local/firstpackage/master/package.ring

	(2) Update Code 	(Better Decision)
		2.1 - Don't add the Master folder to the Path
		2.2 - Use (git command) to change the branch 

			git checkout master 
			git checkout firstpackage-1.1-branch 



===============
Update Command 
===============

ringpm update <package_name>

ringpm update all	---> Update All Packages 

================
Delete Package 
================

ringpm remove <package_name>

	first package 
	second package ---->First Package 
	Third Package  ---->Second Package 

ringpm remove firstpackage ----> Error (Package used by Second Package)
ringpm remove secondpackage ---> Error (Package used by Third Package)
ringpm remove thirdpackage 
		-> Remove (ThirdPackage, SecondPackage, FirstPackage)

[The First Way]
	Get all package.ring files ---> List 
		Package Name , [List Packages that use this package] 
	(N * N) times  ---> How much time for each item? 
		Not very good for performance!

[The Second Way]
	Packages File that we need to update when (Install - Remove - Update)
		Installed Package Name , [List Packages that use this package] 
	
================
Install Package 
================

	ringpm install <package_name>
		
	ringpm install thirdpackage 
			ThirdPackage ---> SecondPackage ---> FirstPackage
			
	Install related packages first, if we have error (cancel operation)		 	

	InstallPackage() ----> ErrorFlag 
		Start ----> ErrorFlag = False 	# NO Error 
		Error ----> ErrorFlag = True	# We have error 
	But we have nested call for InstallPackage()
		We can't use this flag in this simple way

	Two Common Solution
		(1) Check the flag directly after calling installpackage()
			installpackage()
			if ErrorFlag = True return ok
		(2) Use a Counter (ErrorFlag++)
			---> Application (Still Live)
			We don't use this in the Package Manager 
			Because the Package Manager will exit after executing each command
				---> No more operations!


===============
Lock File 
===============

	ringpm install thirdpackage 
		ThirdPackage ---> SecondPackage ---> FirstPackage 

	lock.ring 	for ThirdPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "thirdpackage" , :version = "1.0.0"],
			[:name = "secondpackage", :version = "1.0.1"],
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	lock.ring 	for SecondPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "secondpackage", :version = "1.0.1"],
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	lock.ring 	for FirstPackage
		[ 
			[:name = "firstpackage" , :version = "1.2.0"]
		]

	(1) Each package add it's information in the start of the lock file

	(2) Each package return it's lock information to caller (Parent Package)

	(3) Each package write the lock file after installation 

=================
Dependency Tree 
=================

					[A]
			[B]				[C]

			[D]				[D]
	(Case 1)	v 1.0				v 1.2	Different Versions.
	(Case 2)	v 1.0				v 1.0   The Same Version

	Lock File 	(Different Version)
			A
			B
			D	v 1.0
			C
			D	v 1.2 

	Lock File 	(Same Version)

			A
			B
			D	v 1.0
			C

=====================
List Command 
=====================

	Goal : (Checking for updates ---> Optional)

	ringpm list -u		---> Check updates 

	ringpm list		= (Fast list - Don't check updates)


==============================================
How to avoid the cPackageURL (Global Variable)
==============================================

	cPackageURL --- { GetPackageFile() , DownloadPackageFiles() }

		GetPackageFile() ---> Define Variable
		DownloadPackageFiles() ---> Use 
			called by GetPackage()

	GetPackage()
			call GetPackageFile() ---> Define Variable
			DownloadPackageFiles() ---> Use 

		Scope ( Local | Object State | Global )

	(1) Keep using Global Variable 
		But Save/Restore cPackageURL in GetPackage()
			---> Just 2 lines of code 

	(2) Use Local Variable 		---> Ignore 
		**** Looks like a Simple Solution ****
			But, We will keep passing cPackageURL many times 
			Or we will return it from the function 
				---> Not good for the API

	(3) Class ---> OBJECT ( Object State )

		We created the InstallCommand Class 		

==================================
Installing from different branches 
==================================


	Install Package ---> (master) branch
	Installing from different branch (like v0.9 , v1.2, etc)

	----> Install (Old Version) 

	Example:

		Developer ---> Developed an application (2 years ago)
		User ---> Need simple update 

		Developer ---> Using (Package D) - version 0.9
		Current Version (Package D) - version 1.0 
			--> Breaking Changes 

	Two Solutions 

		(1) Update Code ---> from version 0.9 to 1.0
			---> Need Time 
		(2) Using old version ---> v0.9
			---> Don't have time 
			     The budget is low 
			     No practical need for update 

	Two Features 

		(1) Install Old Version ---> (Install from specific branch)
		(2) Install more than one version from the same package 


	ringpm install <package_name> [ branch <branch_name> ]

	ringpm install d branch v0.9
		
=======================
Delete All Packages
=======================

	(1) ringpm remove all  	----> Ignore 
					So we can have a package with the name "all"

	(2) ringpm format 


=======================
Main Goal
=======================

		* Install Packages ---> Keep packages up to date 

		* Avoid Dependency Hell 
		
			Package (A) -----> Need Package (B) 
							v.   1.2
			Package (C) -----> Neeed Package (B)
							v.   2.1

			Using v. 1.2 ----> For Package (C) (Old Version!)
			Using v. 2.1 ----> For Package (A) (New Version!)
	
			RingPM Support installing multiple versions of the same package 

		* Updates ----> Semantic Versioning 

			Version  Major.Minor.Patch 
				 1.2.1

			Before version 1.0 ---> In Range ( v 0.0.0 ---> 0.x.x ) 
					New version is not compatible with old version 
		
			From Version 1.0.0 (Major.Minor.Patch)
			
			Increase Patch number ---> Fixing bugs 
			Increase Minor number ---> Adding features & improvements 
			Increase Major number ---> Breaking Compatibility 

			v 1.0.0 ------ < 2.0.0
			v 1.9.5 works (No breaking changes)

		* Without semantic versioning ---> We don't have any information about the future 
						   of libraries and their API

			In this case we have two options 

				(1) Use Specific Version (No Updates - Version Lock)
					---> Not good for security & solving bugs 
				(2) Always Update to newer version 
					---> This may break the software at some point 

		* With Semantic Versioning 
				(1) We get updates that works 
				(2) We avoid breaking our software 

		* Important Note 

				(1) Using Semantic Versioning is not enough 
				(2) Sometimes developers don't follow the rules 
				(3) Semantic Versioning works around API changes (Not Behavior)

		* In RingPM to follow semantic versioning 

				(1) Support installing more than one version from the same package
				(2) Add the version name to the package folder 
				(3) Take semantic versioning in mind when checking for updates 

===========================
Easy loading for packages 
===========================

		We don't like using relative path 
			# load "../y-0.9.0/lib.ring"
			# load "../z/lib.ring"
			
		We need to support writing the package|library name directly 
			# load "y-0.9.0.ring"
			# load "z.ring"
			
		As we did with the standard Ring libraries 
			# load "stdlib.ring"  #	===> ring/ringlibs/stdlib/stdlib.ring
			# load "guilib.ring"  #	===> ring/extensions/ringqt/guilib/guilib.ring
			

		Our Solution 

			Create y-0.9.0.ring in ring/bin folder 
				load "/../ringpm/packages/y-0.9.0/lib.ring"

			Create z.ring in ring/bin folder 
				load "/../ringpm/packages/z/lib.ring"

		Test 
			mylib.ring ---> ring/bin 
				load "/../ringpm/packages/mylib/lib.ring"

=================
Packages Registry
=================

	List of packages [ Package Name , Developer, Email, Description, 
				ProviderUserName, ProviderWebsite (GitHub) ]

	registry.ring ====> Contains list of All Packages 
		aPackages = [
			[ :name = "Package Name",
			  :description = "Package Description",
			  :developer = "Mahmoud", Email = "...",
			  :ProviderUserName = "MahmoudFayed",
			  :ProviderWebsite = "GitHub"
			]
		]

	ringpm search <keywords...>
	ringpm install <package_name>
			(1) Search in the Local Folder (ringpm/local) 
			(2) if not found 
				----> Check for registry.ring updates 
				----> Search in the registry.ring file

	We expect package description to be from 200 to 500 bytes 

	How many packages we expect in the registry?

		Current State ---> Expect from 1000 to 2000 packages 
				  To cover (Samples, Applications, Libraries, Extensions, etcs)

		Next stage ----> We expect 10,000 packages 

		Third stage ----> 100,000 packages 

		Top languages ---> 500,000 packages ----> 1000,000 packages 


	Expected registry.ring size = (10,000 * 500 bytes) = 5000000 bytes (Less than 5 MBytes)
			100,000 packages = 50 MBytes 
			1000,000 packages = 500 MBytes

	Using download() to check the file each time is not practical 

	So we will add another file beside registry.ring to include the revision number  

		rev.ring ----> rev = 1		( or version.ring )
	When we update the registry.ring file, we will increment the revision counter
				rev++ 

	But we expect many updates to the package index (Maybe each day/week ?)

		So, after each revision, We will create a file with the new updates only 

		update_rev1.ring 
		update_rev2.ring 
 	
	But the updates may include updating current packages data, removing a package 
		So we may need more control in the update file. 

	Another solution 

		Keep the large file ---> Don't think about little updates 
		But update only based on the user decision 

			(Lazy Solution) 

		Or update each 7 days 

	ringpm refresh ----> Update the registry (Packages List)

		version.ring 
			nRegistryRev  		= 1
			cRegistryLastUpdate 	= "2018/11/20"
			nPackagesCount 		= 3	# (firstpackage, secondpackage, thirdpackage)
