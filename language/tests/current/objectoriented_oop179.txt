==================================================
One day, I will no longer remain just a function.
One day, I will live as a method inside an object.
That object will have a place in a 3D world.
And it will have the x, y, and z attributes.
Not yet!

X= 10
Y= 20

The dream has come true.
x: 10
y: 20
