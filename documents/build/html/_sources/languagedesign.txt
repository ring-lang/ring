	pair: Language Design; Why Ring?

Why Ring?
=========

The language is simple, trying to be natural, encourage organization and comes 
with transparent and visual implementation. It comes with compact syntax and a
group of features that enable the programmer to create natural interfaces and
declarative domain-specific languages in a fraction of time. It is very small,
fast and comes with smart garbage collector that puts the memory under the 
programmer control. It supports many programming paradigms, comes with useful 
and practical libraries. The language is designed for productivity and developing
high quality solutions that can scale.

	pair: Language Design; Designed for a clear goal

Designed for a Clear Goal
=========================

* Applications programming language.
* Productivity and developing high quality solutions that can scale.
* Small and fast language that can be embedded in C/C++ projects.
* Simple language that can be used in education and introducing Compiler/VM concepts.
* General-Purpose language that can be used for creating domain-specific libraries, frameworks and tools.
* Practical language designed for creating the next version of the Programming Without Coding Technology software.

	pair: Language Design; Simple

Simple
======

Ring is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate code

.. code-block:: ring

	See "Hello, World!" 

The Main function is optional and will be executed after the statements, and is useful for using the local scope.

.. code-block:: ring

	Func Main
		See "Hello, World!" 
		
Uses Dynamic Typing and Lexical scoping. No $ is required before the variable name! 
You can use the '+' operator for string concatenation and the language is weakly typed and will convert automatically between numbers and strings based on the context.

.. code-block:: ring

	nCount = 10	# Global variable
	Func Main
		nID = 1	# Local variable
		See "Count = " + nCount + nl + " ID = " + nID

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Trying to be natural

Trying to be natural
====================

Ring is not case-sensitive

.. code-block:: ring


	See "Enter your name ? " 
	Give name
	See "Hello " + Name	# Name is the same as name 
			
The list index starts from 1

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = ["one","two","three"]
	See aList[1]	# print one
			
Call functions before definition

.. code-block:: ring


	one() 
	two() 
	three()
	Func one 
		See "One" + nl
	Func two 
		See "two" + nl
	Func three 
		See "three" + nl
			
The assignment operator uses Deep copy (no references in this operation)

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = ["one","two","three"]
	aList2 = aList
	aList[1] = 1
	see alist[1]	# print 1
	see aList2[1]	# print one
				
Pass numbers and strings by value, but pass lists and objects by reference. 
The for in loop can update the list items.

.. code-block:: ring

	Func Main
		aList = [1,2,3]
		update(aList)
		see aList	# print one two three

	Func update aList
		for x in aList
			switch x
			on 1 x = "one"
			on 2 x = "two"
			on 3 x = "three"
			off
		next
			
Using Lists during definition

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = [ [1,2,3,4,5] , aList[1] , aList[1] ]
	see aList       # print 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
			
Exit from more than one loop

.. code-block:: ring

	for x = 1 to 10
			for y = 1 to 10
					see "x=" + x + " y=" + y + nl
					if x = 3 and y = 5
							exit 2     # exit from 2 loops
					ok
			next
	next
	
.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Encourage Organization

Encourage Organization
======================

The language encourage organization, Forget bad days using languages where the programmer start with function then class then function and a strange mix between things! 

Each source file follow the next structure 

* Load Files
* Statements and Global Variables
* Functions
* Packages and Classes

This enable us to use Packages, Classes and Functions without the need to use a keyword to end these components. 

We can write one line comments and multi-line comments 
The comment starts with # or // 
Multi-line comments are written between /* and */

.. code-block:: ring

	/* 
		Program Name : My first program using Ring
		Date         : 2015.05.08
	*/

	See "What is your name? " 	# print message on screen
	give cName 			# get input from the user
	see "Hello " + cName		# say hello!

	// See "Bye!"
				

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Data Representation

Data Representation
===================

Ring contains only 4 types that represent the program data

These types are (String, Number, List & Object)

The idea is to have many use cases for each type which increase the flexibility and the ability
to write functions that are more usable in different situations.

The String type is used to represent:
* One character
* A string of many characters
* Multi-line string
* Binary Data 

.. code-block:: ring

	cStr1 = "a"			# One character
	cStr2 = "Hello, World!" 	# A string of many characters
	cStr3 = "Hello
	Welcome to the Ring language!
	"				# Multi-line string
	cStr4 = read(EXEFileName())	# Read executable file (Binary Data)

The Number type is used to represent
* Boolean Values 
* Signed/Unsigned Integers
* Float/Double 

.. code-block:: ring

	nNum1 = True		# Boolean Value (1) 
	nNum2 = False		# Boolean Value (0)
	nNum3 = 10		# Integer
	nNum4 = -10		# Signed Integer
	nNum5 = 1250.11		# Float/Double

The List type is used instead of
* One Dimension Arrays
* Multi-Dimension Arrays
* Lists of multiple types
* Nested Lists
* Hash Tables (Key & Value)
* Tree
* Wrapper around a C Pointer

.. code-block:: ring

	aList1 = ["one","two","three"]				# Strings
	aList2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]				# Numbers
	aList3 = ["Ring",1234]					# Multiple types
	aList4 = [["Fayed","Egypt"],["Mansour","Tunisia"]]  	# Nested Lists
	aList5 = [ :name = "Fayed", :country = "Egypt"]		# Hash Tables

The Object type is used to represent objects created from classes

Using classes and operator overloading we can create custom types 


.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Compact Syntax

Compact Syntax
==============

The language is not line sensitive, you don't need to write ; after statements, also you don't need to press ENTER or TAB, so we can write the next code

.. code-block:: ring


	See "The First Message"	See " Another message in the same line! " + nl
	See "Enter your name?" Give Name See "Hello " + Name
			
The next code create a class called Point contains three attributes X,Y and Z. No keywords is used to end the package/class/function definition. Also, we can write the attributes names directly below the class name.

.. code-block:: ring

	Class Point X Y Z
			
We can use classes and functions before their definition, In this example we will create new object, set the object attributes then print the object values.

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = New point	o1.x=10    o1.y=20   o1.z=30	See O1	Class Point X Y Z
			
Instead of using the dot '.' operator to access the object attributes and methods we can use braces { } to access the object, then we can use the object attributes and methods.

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = New point { x=10 y=20 z=30 } See O1  Class Point X Y Z
			 
Now we will call a method after accessing the object using { }

.. code-block:: ring

	 
	oPerson = new Person
	{
		Name = "Somebody"
		Address = "Somewhere"
		Phone = "0000000"
		Print()			# here we call the Print() method
	}
	Class Person Name Address Phone
		Func Print
			See "Name :" + name + nl +
				"Address :" + Address + nl +
				"Phone : " + phone + nl

When we use { } to access the object then write any attribute name, the language will check the class for any setter/getter methods that will be called automatically.

.. code-block:: ring


	New Number {
			See one		# Execute GetOne()
			See two		# Execute GetTwo()
			See three	# Execute GetThree()
	}
	Class Number one two three
		Func GetOne
			See "Number : One" + nl
			return 1
		Func GetTwo
			See "Number : Two" + nl
			return 2
		Func GetThree
			See "Number : Three" + nl
			return 3	
			
.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Define Natural Statements

Define Natural Statements
=========================

After the object access using { } if the class contains a method called BraceEnd() it will be executed!

.. code-block:: ring


	TimeForFun = new journey
	# The first surprise!
	TimeForFun {
		Hello it is me		# What a beautiful programming world!
	}
	# Our Class
	Class journey
		hello=0 it=0 is=0 me=0
		func GetHello
			See "Hello" + nl
		func braceEnd
			See "Goodbye!" + nl

We can execute code written in strings using the Eval() function

.. code-block:: ring


	cCode = "See 'Code that will be executed later!' "
	Eval(cCode)	# execute the code to print the message

We can create a list then execute code generated from that list

.. code-block:: ring

	aWords = ["hello","it","is","me"]
	for word in aWords cCode=word+"=0" eval(cCode) next

We can read text files using the Read(cFileName) function and we can write files using the Write(cFileName,cString) function.

.. code-block:: ring

	See "Enter File Name:" Give cFileName See Read(cFileName) # Print the file content

The next example presents how to create a class that defines two instructions
The first instruction is : I want window
The second instruction is : Window title = Expression 
Also keywords that can be ignored like the ‘the’ keyword 

.. code-block:: ring


	New App
	{
		I want window
		The window title = "hello world"
	}

	Class App

		# Attributes for the instruction I want window
			i want window
			nIwantwindow = 0
		# Attributes for the instruction Window title
		# Here we don't define the window attribute again
			title
			nWindowTitle = 0
		# Keywords to ignore, just give them any value
			the=0

		func geti
				if nIwantwindow = 0
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

		func getwant
				if nIwantwindow = 1
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

		func getwindow
				if nIwantwindow = 2
					nIwantwindow= 0
					see "Instruction : I want window" + nl
				ok
				if nWindowTitle = 0
					nWindowTitle++
				ok

		func settitle cValue
				if nWindowTitle = 1
					nWindowTitle=0
					see "Instruction : Window Title = " + cValue + nl
				ok

		
To complete the previous example, use read() to get the content of a file that contains

.. code-block:: ring

	I want window
	The window title = "hello world"

Then use eval() to execute the content of that file!.
Also, you can update the methods GetWindow() and SetTitle() to create Real windows using the GUI Library


.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Define Declarative Languages

Define Declarative Languages
============================


We learned how to use Natural statements to execute our code and using the same features we can use nested structures to execute our code.

The next example from the Web library, generate HTML document using the Bootstrap library. No HTML code is written directly in this example, we created a similar language (just as example) Then using this declarative language that uses nested structures, we generated the HTML Document.. 
The idea in this example is that the GetDiv() and GetH1() methods return an object that we can access using {} and after each object access the method BraceEnd() will be executed to send the generated HTML to the parent object until we reach to the root where BraceEnd() will print the output.

.. code-block:: ring

	Load "weblib.ring"
	Import System.Web

	Func Main

	  BootStrapWebPage()
	  {
		div
		{
		  classname = :container
		  div
		  {
			classname = :jumbotron
			H1 {   text("Bootstrap Page")   }
		  }
		  div
		  {
			classname = :row
			for x = 1 to 3
			  div
			  {
			    classname = "col-sm-4"
			    H3 { html("Welcome to the Ring programming language") }
			    P  { html("Using a scripting language is very fun!") }
			  }
			next
		  }
		}
	  }

The classes that power the declarative interface looks like this

.. code-block:: ring

	Class Link from ObjsBase
		title  link
		Func braceend			
			cOutput = nl+GetTabs() + "<a href='" + 
				  Link + "'> "+ Title + " </a> " + nl			

	Class Div from ObjsBase 
		Func braceend
			cOutput += nl+'<div'
			addattributes()
			AddStyle()
			getobjsdata()
			cOutput += nl+"</div>" + nl
			cOutput = TabMLString(cOutput)

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Transparent Implementation

Transparent Implementation
==========================

Ring comes with transparent implementation. We can know what is happening in each compiler stage and what is going on during the run-time by the Virtual Machine Example : ring helloworld.ring -tokens -rules -ic

.. code-block:: ring

	See "Hello, World!" 
			
Output

.. code-block:: ring


	==================================================================
	Tokens - Generated by the Scanner

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Visual Implementation

Visual Implementation
=====================

The Ring programming language is designed using the PWCT visual programming tool 
and you will find the visual source of the language in the folder "language/visualsrc" - *.ssf 
files and the generated source code (In the C Language) in the	language/src folder and 
the language/include folder.

The next screen shot from the ring_vm.ssf file (Generate ring_vm.c and ring_vm.h)

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Smart Garbage Collector

Smart Garbage Collector
=======================

Avoid memory problems :- 

* Invalid Memory Access
* Memory leaks
* Uninitialized Memory Access
* Dangling pointer

Rules :- 

* Global variables always stay in the memory, until you delete these variables using the assignment statement.
* Local variables always deleted after the end of the function.
* The programmer have full control on when to delete the variable from the memory using the Assignment statement.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = [1,2,3,4,5]
	aList = "nice"
			
After the second line directly, The list [1,2,3,4,5] will be deleted from the memory and we will have a string "nice" 

* The programmer can call the function callgc() to force running the garbage collector.
* If we have a reference to a variable (when we pass objects and lists to functions), then deleting variables will be based on reference counting, if no references everything will be deleted, but if we have a reference, the data will stay in memory.


.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; No Global Interpreter (VM) Lock - No GIL

No Global Interpreter (VM) Lock - No GIL
========================================

When we use threads in Ring applications, We don't have global interpreter (VM) lock (No GIL)

So threads can work in parallel and execute Ring instructions at the same time

This is better for threads and concurrency (More Faster!)

.. index:: 
	pair: Language Design; Fast Enough For Many Applications

Fast Enough For Many Applications
=================================

Ring is designed to be a simple, small and flexible language in the first place, but also it is fast enough for many applications.

Ring can do each of the next tasks in around 1 second using normal computers in the market during the last 5 years

(1) Compiling 100,000 lines of code
(2) Executing empty loop that count from 1 to 10,000,000
(3) Executing 1000 search operation using linear search in a list contains 100,000 items, trying to find the last item (The worst case)
(4) Creating list contains 1,000,000 items then summing all of the list items
(5) Adding 20,000 items to the ListWidget in GUI applications
(6) Adding 5,000 nodes to the TreeWidget in GUI applications
(7) Printing 10,000 messages to the terminal in Console applications

Also when we need more speed we can use C/C++ extensions!
