	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Functions

Better Functions
================

* isWindows64() function - Better Code
* print() function - Better code to handle apostrophe inside text
* random() function - Produce numeric output when the parameter is a negative number or zero
* reverse() function - Beside supporting lists, the function now support strings too
* add() function - when adding a list support adding each item alone
* list2str() function - Support more parameters: list2str(aList,[nStart],[nEnd])
* isDigit(), isAlpha(), isAlnum(), etc. will return False if the input is an empty string
* number() function - Produce runtime error if the string contains invalid number
* input() function - If the size is not passed as parameter it will read a line
* locals() function - Usage in global scope will not return predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* Swap() function - Support swaping any two Lists/Objects 

Example (1):

.. code-block:: ring

	cStr = "Welcome to Ring"
	? reverse(cStr)			# gniR ot emocleW

Example (2):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = 1:3
	add(aList,4:6)			# Add the list as one item
	? len(aList)			# 4 

	aList = 1:3
	add(aList,4:6,True)		# Add each item alone
	? len(aList)			# 6 
	? aList

Example (3):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = 1:10
	cStr  = list2str(aList,6,10)
	? cStr				# 6 7 8 9 10

Example (4):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList1 = 4:6
	aList2 = 1:3
	swap(aList1,aList2)
	? aList1			# 1 2 3
	? aList2			# 4 5 6

	aList = [ 4:6 , 1:3 ]
	? aList				# 4 5 6 1 2 3
	swap(aList[1], aList[2])
	? aList				# 1 2 3 4 5 6

	aList = [ 4:6 , 1:3 ]
	? aList				# 4 5 6 1 2 3
	swap(aList,1,2)
	? aList				# 1 2 3 4 5 6

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Enable/Disable Hash Comments

Enable/Disable Hash Comments
============================

We added the next two commands to the Ring Scanner

* EnableHashComments
* DisableHashComments

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	DisableHashComments
	#define = 10
	EnableHashComments
	# Just a comment
	DisableHashComments
	? #define
	EnableHashComments
	# End of program

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Performance when using Braces

Better Performance when using Braces
====================================

Using braces to access objects is faster in Ring 1.20 than Ring 1.19

The performance gain could be from 120% to 160%

Tested using Victus Laptop [13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700H, Windows 11]

Using normal functions or using the dot operator still faster than using braces, but this update is a step forward towards reducing the gap.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	oPoint = new Point

	t1 = clock()
	for t=1 to 100000
		oPoint {
			# Access object attributes|methods
		}
	next	
	? (clock()-t1)/clocksPerSecond()

	class point x y z

* Time using Ring 1.20: 0.05 second
* Time using Ring 1.19: 0.13 second
* Time using Ring 1.18: 0.38 second

.. note:: We have written this example in this slow way to do the test

A very fast version of the sample will could be written by using braces before the loop

.. code-block:: ring

	oPoint = new Point

	t1 = clock()
	oPoint {
		for t=1 to 100000
			# Access object attributes|methods
		next	
	}
	? (clock()-t1)/clocksPerSecond()

	class point x y z

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Support for Threads

Better Support for Threads
==========================

* Better code inside Ring VM for starting new threads 
* Better code for sharing the Memory Pool information between threads 
* Each thread have it's copy from predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* Ring lists that wraps C pointers will not use internal dynamic cache
* Ring lists created using List() will not use internal dynamic cache if size is not changed
* RingThreads - Better code for creating the Mutex

.. note:: Ring Lists that avoid internal dynamic cache provide safe reading from many threads because accessing lists for reading will not include implicit writing to the internal cache.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; RingRogueUtil Extension

RingRogueUtil Extension
=======================

Using this extension we can create text-based user interfaces (TUI) and console-based games

The extension support Windows, Linux and macOS

Also, we added support for Mouse events (Mouse move, Click, and Scroll)

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "rogueutil.ring"

	setConsoleTitle("Using PrintXY()")

	setColor(Black)
	setBackgroundColor(Cyan)

	cls()

	printXY(10,2,'In Mathematics, we call multiplying a number by itself "squaring" the number.')

	for t=1 to 12
		printXY(10,10+t, "Number: " + t + " x " + t + " = " + (t*t) )
	next

	getch()
