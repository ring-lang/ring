	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Functions

Better Functions
================

* isWindows64() function - Better Code
* print() function - Better code to handle apostrophe inside text
* random() function - Produce numeric output when the parameter is a negative number or zero
* reverse() function - Beside supporting lists, the function now support strings too
* add() function - when adding a list support adding each item alone
* list2str() function - Support more parameters: list2str(aList,[nStart],[nEnd])
* isDigit(), isAlpha(), isAlnum(), etc. will return False if the input is an empty string
* number() function - Produce runtime error if the string contains invalid number
* input() function - If the size is not passed as parameter it will read a line
* locals() function - Usage in global scope will not return predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* swap() function - Support swaping any two Lists/Objects 
* sleep() function (from stdlibcore.ring) - Better implementation 
* ring_state_mainfile() function - Support Ring Object Files
* updateList() function (from fastpro.ring) - support dest. column as six parameter

Example (1):

.. code-block:: ring

	cStr = "Welcome to Ring"
	? reverse(cStr)			# gniR ot emocleW

Example (2):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = 1:3
	add(aList,4:6)			# Add the list as one item
	? len(aList)			# 4 

	aList = 1:3
	add(aList,4:6,True)		# Add each item alone
	? len(aList)			# 6 
	? aList

Example (3):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = 1:10
	cStr  = list2str(aList,6,10)
	? cStr				# 6 7 8 9 10

Example (4):

.. code-block:: ring

	aList1 = 4:6
	aList2 = 1:3
	swap(aList1,aList2)
	? aList1			# 1 2 3
	? aList2			# 4 5 6

	aList = [ 4:6 , 1:3 ]
	? aList				# 4 5 6 1 2 3
	swap(aList[1], aList[2])
	? aList				# 1 2 3 4 5 6

	aList = [ 4:6 , 1:3 ]
	? aList				# 4 5 6 1 2 3
	swap(aList,1,2)
	? aList				# 1 2 3 4 5 6

Example (6):

.. code-block:: ring

	load "fastpro.ring"

	aList = [
		[10,20,0],
		[30,40,0],
		[50,60,0]
	]

	updateList(aList,:mul,:col,1,10,3)

	? aList		# 10 20 100 30 40 300 50 60 500


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Enable/Disable Hash Comments

Enable/Disable Hash Comments
============================

We added the next two commands to the Ring Scanner

* EnableHashComments
* DisableHashComments

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	DisableHashComments
	#define = 10
	EnableHashComments
	# Just a comment
	DisableHashComments
	? #define
	EnableHashComments
	# End of program

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Files for Loading the StdLib

Better Files for Loading the StdLib
===================================

Using stdlib.ring will load stdlib functions, classes and some extensions too like RingLibCurl, RingOpenSSL, etc.

Using stdlibcore.ring we can only load stdlib functions.

In this release we provide stdlibclasses.ring that can only load stdlib classes without loading stdlib functions or extensions. 

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "stdlibclasses.ring"

	oStack = new Stack {
		push("A")
		push("B")
		push("C")
		push("D")
		push("E")
		pop()
		pop()
		print()
	}

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	C
	B
	A

.. note:: Also, we improved the files that load the library to load it in separate global scope.

.. tip:: To load a library in separate global scope use the Load Package command.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Performance when using Braces

Better Performance when using Braces
====================================

Using braces to access objects is faster in Ring 1.20 than Ring 1.19

The performance gain could be from 120% to 160%

Tested using Victus Laptop [13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700H, Windows 11]

Using normal functions or using the dot operator still faster than using braces, but this update is a step forward towards reducing the gap.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	oPoint = new Point

	t1 = clock()
	for t=1 to 100000
		oPoint {
			# Access object attributes|methods
		}
	next	
	? (clock()-t1)/clocksPerSecond()

	class point x y z

* Time using Ring 1.20: 0.05 second
* Time using Ring 1.19: 0.13 second
* Time using Ring 1.18: 0.38 second

.. note:: We have written this example in this slow way to do the test

A very fast version of the sample will could be written by using braces before the loop

.. code-block:: ring

	oPoint = new Point

	t1 = clock()
	oPoint {
		for t=1 to 100000
			# Access object attributes|methods
		next	
	}
	? (clock()-t1)/clocksPerSecond()

	class point x y z

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Better Support for Threads

Better Support for Threads
==========================

* Better code inside Ring VM for starting new threads 
* Better code for sharing the Memory Pool information between threads 
* Each thread have it's copy from predefined globals like NL, True, etc.
* Share multiple global scopes created using the Load Package command 
* Ring lists that wraps C pointers will not use internal dynamic cache
* Ring lists created using List() will not use internal dynamic cache if size is not changed
* RingThreads - Better code for creating the Mutex

.. note:: Ring Lists that avoid internal dynamic cache provide safe reading from many threads because accessing lists for reading will not include implicit writing to the internal cache.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; RingRogueUtil Extension

RingRogueUtil Extension
=======================

Using this extension we can create text-based user interfaces (TUI) and console-based games

The extension support Windows, Linux and macOS

Also, we added support for Mouse events (Mouse move, Click, and Scroll)

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "rogueutil.ring"

	setConsoleTitle("Using PrintXY()")

	setColor(Black)
	setBackgroundColor(Cyan)

	cls()

	printXY(10,2,'In Mathematics, we call multiplying a number by itself "squaring" the number.')

	for t=1 to 12
		printXY(10,10+t, "Number: " + t + " x " + t + " = " + (t*t) )
	next

	getch()

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.20; Pause/Resume Embedded Ring VM

Pause/Resume Embedded Ring VM
=============================

Ring already supports embedding Ring VM in Ring programs to be able to execute Ring code in isloated Ring state.

Starting from Ring 1.20 we can pause/resume the embedded Ring VM

To pause the VM, just use the (Bye) command which as expected will end the execution but will store
the nPC value (Program Counter) so using ring_state_resume() we can continue the execution at any time starting from this nPC value.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: ring

	ring_state_resume(oState,[cPara|nPara],[lUseReturn])

To learn more about this feature check the chapter: Embedding Ring in Ring
