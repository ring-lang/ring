	pair: Ring Notepad; The Main File in the Project

The Main File in the Project
============================

The idea of the Main File ToolBar is to determine the main file in the project When the project contains many source code files

Using this feature we can run the project (Main File) at any time while opening other files in the project without the need to switch to the Main File to run the project.

To quickly use this feature

(Open the project main file)

Press Ctrl+Shift+M to set the current source code file as the main file

Open and modify other source code files in the project

To run the project (Main File) at any time press Ctrl+Shift+F5 (GUI) or Ctrl+Shift+D (Console)
