List of changes and new features
================================

Ring 1.26 comes with the next features!

* Rust Bindings for Ring

Rust Bindings for Ring
======================

URL: https://github.com/ysdragon/ring-lang-rs

* Write Ring extensions in Rust (Native extensions with Rust's safety and performance)

* Embed Ring in Rust applications (Run Ring scripts from your Rust programs)

* Wrap Rust crates for Ring (Expose any Rust library to Ring applications)

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.26?; Closure Package

Closure Library
===============

We can create an anonymous function that capture specific variables. 

Using closure() capture variables by value. 

For lists/objects we can change this behaviour (optional) using the Ref() function. 

The first parameter to closure() is a list of variables to capture we can type

* :variable_name
* :variable_name = value
* :variable_name = ref(list/object)

The second parameter is an anonymous function that could use the captured variables

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "closure.ring"

	func main

		inc = increment()

		? isClosure(inc) # Prints 1

		? invoke(inc) # Prints 11
		? invoke(inc) # Prints 12

		for m = 1 to 1000
			invoke(inc)
		next

		? invoke(inc)

		dec = decrement()
		? invoke(dec)
		? invoke(inc)
		? invoke(dec)

	func increment

		x = 10

		return closure([:x], func {
			x++
			return x
		})

	func decrement

		x = 100

		return closure([:x], func {
			x--
			return x
		})

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	1
	11
	12
	1013
	99
	1014
	98

More RingPM Packages
====================

The following packages have been added to the RingPM registry.

* Proc: Subprocess management library
* Archive: Archive manipulation library
* TUIFrameworkUsingClaudeCode: A project developed using prompt driven development

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring  1.26; More Improvements

More Improvements
=================

* NaturalLib - Improved implementation for supporting shared keywords across commands
* RingStbImage - The stb_image.h file is updated from v2.28 to v2.30
* Left(cStr,nCount) - Return cStr when the requested size exceeds the string length
* Right(cStr,nCount) - Return cStr when the requested size exceeds the string length
* SubStr(cStr,nPos,nCount) - Return cStr when the requested size exceeds the string length
* Ring Lists - ring_list_deleteitem_gc() - Better implementation (order of operations)
