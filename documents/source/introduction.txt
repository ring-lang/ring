	:alt: The Ring Programming Language

Welcome to the Ring programming language!

Ring is an Innovative and practical general-purpose multi-paradigm language
that can be embedded in C/C++ projects, extended using C/C++ code and/or used as standalone language.
The supported programming paradigms are Imperative, Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional,
Meta programming, Declarative programming using nested structures, and Natural programming.
The language is portable (MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, WebAssembly, etc.) and can be used to create
Console, GUI, Web, Games and Mobile applications. The language is designed to be Simple, Small and 
Flexible. Also, It's fast enough for many applications. Its Dynamic Language that compile the source
code to byte code then execute it by the Ring Virtual Machine, which is integrated with the Ring
Compiler in one program.

In this chapter we are going to discuss the goals behind the language design and implementation.

Motivation (1)
==============

In Nov. 2011, I started to think about creating a new version of the 
`Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) <https://doublesvsoop.sourceforge.net/>`_ software from scratch.

I was interested in creating multi-platform edition of the software beside adding support for
Web & Mobile development.

What I was looking for is a programming language that can be used to build the development 
environment, provides multi-platform support, more productivity, better performance, can be used for components scripting and developing different kinds of applications.

Instead of using a mix of programming languages, I decided to use one programming language. 

I looked at many programming languages, but I discovered that I need 
a different language that comes with new ideas and intelligent implementation.


.. note:: The importance of the PWCT project to the Ring language design is similar to the importance of the Unix operating system to the C language design. Having a specific project in the mind of a programming language designer help a lot in taking the right decisions towards a clear goal. For example, We know that the PWCT visual programming language will provide readability, this let us focus in Ring design on writability. So, we can get maximum readability and maximum writability at the same time since both languages are designed together. Also, PWCT as a visual language requires powerful GUI library and fast graphics. That's why Ring comes with support for the Qt framework as it's primary GUI toolkit.

Motivation (2)
==============

In 2009-2010, I developed a small domain-specific programming language for GUI development called Supernova.
I invested many months of my time to create this language and get something that I can use for small programs.
After creating Supernova, I realized that if the programming language have some new features on the top of object-oriented programming, it could help me to create a domain-specific language like Supernova in days instead of many months. So Ring as a language provide these features, and using Ring we can create Supernova and enjoy it's features in real-world applications development. Ring is designed to be a superset of Supernova and enable us to create many domain-specific languages.


.. note:: The role that Supernova language played for the Ring language design is similar to the role played by the ABC language for the Python language design. When you create a programming language and try to use it in practical, you will learn a lot of lessons that help a lot when designing another language influnced by this language.

Ring and other languages
========================

Ring is a programming language that comes with better support for Natural Language 
Programming and Declarative Programming.
The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms with new practical techniques on the top of 
Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.

Also, Ring is influenced by the next programming languages

* Lua
* Python
* Ruby
* C
* C#
* BASIC
* QML
* xBase
* Supernova

	pair: Introduction ; History

History
=======

In Sept. 2013 I started the design and the implementation of the Ring programming language.
After 21 months of development, In May 2015 the language Compiler & Virtual Machine were ready for use!

After that I spent three months testing the language again, trying to discover any bug to fix, writing better tests,
by the end of August 2015, all know bugs were fixed, Writing many tests and testing automation helped a lot in 
getting a stable product.

In September 12, 2015, most of the documentation was written. Before releasing the language I started the marketing by
writing a post in Arabic language about it to my facebook profile page asking for contributors interested in the language 
idea after reading a short description, In the same day I got a lot of emails from developers and friends interested to contribute!
