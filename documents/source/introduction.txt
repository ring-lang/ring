	:alt: The Ring Programming Language

Welcome to the Ring programming language!

Ring is an Innovative and practical general-purpose multi-paradigm language
that can be embedded in C/C++ projects, extended using C/C++ code and/or used as standalone language.
The supported programming paradigms are Imperative, Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional,
Meta programming, Declarative programming using nested structures, and Natural programming.
The language is portable (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, etc.) and can be used to create
Console, GUI, Web, Games and Mobile applications. The language is designed to be Simple, Small,
Flexible and Fast. Its Dynamic Language that compile the source
code to byte code then execute it by the Ring Virtual Machine, which is integrated with the Ring
Compiler in one program.

In this chapter we are going to discuss the goals behind the language design and implementation.

	pair: Introduction; Motivation

Motivation
==========

In Nov. 2011, I started to think about creating a new version of the 
`Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) <http://doublesvsoop.sf.net/>`_ software from scratch.

I was interested in creating multi-platform edition of the software beside adding support for
Web & Mobile development.

What I was looking for is a programming language that can be used to build the development 
environment, provides multi-platform support, more productivity, better performance, can be used for components 
scripting and developing different kinds of applications.

Instead of using a mix of programming languages, I decided to use one programming language. 

I looked at many programming languages, but I discovered that I need 
a different language that comes with new ideas and intelligent implementation.

Ring and other languages
========================

Ring is an innovative programming language that comes with better support for Natural Language 
Programming and Declarative Programming.
The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms with new practical techniques on the top of 
Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.

Also Ring is influenced by the next programming languages

* Lua
* Python
* Ruby
* C
* C#
* BASIC
* QML
* xBase
* Supernova

	pair: Introduction ; History

History
=======

In Sept. 2013 I started the design and the implementation of the Ring programming language.
After 21 months of development, In May 2015 the language Compiler & Virtual Machine were ready for use!

After that I spent three months testing the language again, trying to discover any bug to fix, writing better tests,
by the end of August 2015, all know bugs were fixed, Writing many tests and testing automation helped a lot in 
getting a stable product.

In September 12, 2015, most of the documentation was written. Before releasing the language I started the marketing by
writing a post in Arabic language about it to my facebook profile page asking for contributors interested in the language 
idea after reading a short description, In the same day I got a lot of emails from developers and friends interested to contribute!

Features
========

The Ring language comes with the next features

.. tip:: The language is ready for production!

* Free Open Source (MIT License)
* Hybrid Implementation (Compiler + Virtual Machine) 
* Declarative programming on the top of Object-Oriented programming
* Natural Language Programming on the top of Object-Oriented programming
* Natural Language Programming Library
* Three different styles for writing the code and you can create your style 
* Syntax Flexibility (You can change the language keywords and operators)
* The language keywords can be translated from English to other languages (Arabic, French, etc)
* Compact Syntax, No explicit end for statements (No ; or ENTER is required)
* Using braces { } we can access objects and use attributes/methods as variables/functions
* Transparent Implementation (See the Tokens, Grammar, and Byte Code for each program) 
* Visual Implementation - Developed using Visual Programming (PWCT) 
* Written in ANSI C (The code is generated + Looks identical to Handwritten Code)
* A small language
	* The compiler + The Virtual Machine (20,000 lines of C code)
	* The other 500,000 lines of code are related to libraries!
* Portable (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, etc)
* Comments (One line & Multi-lines)
* Not Case-Sensitive
* Dynamic Typing
* Weakly typed (Automatic conversion between numbers and strings only)
* Lexical Scoping (Global, Local & Object State)
* Default scope for variables inside functions (Local)
* Default scope for variables outside functions (global)
* We can have separate global scope for each library or sub project
* Garbage Collector - Automatic Memory Management (Escape Analysis and Reference Counting)
* In most cases (90%) using Escape Analysis we don't need to run the Garbage Collector (Faster)
* Structure Programming
* Rich control structures & Operators
* For in get item by reference not value, you can read/edit the item
* Use exit to go outside from more than one loop (Use it for programming in the small only)
* Procedures/Functions
* Main Function (Optional - To avoid using the Global Scope)
* Call Function before the definition (Top-Down Programming)
* Recursion
* Multi-line literals
* Access (read/write) string letter by index
* The list index start by 1
* No keyword to end Functions/Classes/Packages
* Range operator ex: 1:10 and "a":"z"
* First Class Variables, Lists, Objects and Functions
* Store/Copy Lists/Objects by value (Deep Copy)

	* private state (optional)
	* Instantiation
	* Polymorphism
