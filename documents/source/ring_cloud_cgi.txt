Deploying Ring CGI Applications to Shared Hosting and Cloud Servers
===================================================================

While modern application deployment often involves containers, many hosting environments—especially traditional shared hosting panels like cPanel and Plesk—do not allow running persistent background processes. For these platforms, the classic **CGI (Common Gateway Interface)** model remains the perfect and most compatible solution.

This tutorial guides you through deploying Ring applications as CGI scripts. We will use a powerful, secure CGI wrapper script that makes the process robust and reliable across different hosting environments.

1. Introduction: The CGI Model
------------------------------

CGI is a standard protocol that allows a web server (like Apache or Nginx) to execute external scripts to generate web pages dynamically.

   * - Docker / Modern Server Model
     - Classic CGI Model
   * - Your Ring app is a long-running server using ``httplib``.
     - Your Ring app is a simple script that **runs and exits** on each request.
   * - The web server acts as a **Reverse Proxy**, forwarding traffic.
     - The web server acts as an **Executor**, running your script directly.
   * - Requires ``root`` or ``sudo`` access on a VM to run Docker.
     - Works on virtually any shared hosting plan with minimal permissions.
   * - Deployment is typically done via ``docker compose up``.
     - Deployment is done by uploading files (e.g., via FTP/SFTP).

The CGI model is incredibly portable and has been a workhorse of the web for decades, making it ideal for environments with limited control.

2. Prerequisites
----------------

*   Access to a web hosting environment (either a shared hosting panel or a cloud VM with ``sudo`` access).
*   A way to upload files (e.g., a **File Manager** in your control panel, or an SFTP client like FileZilla).
*   A basic understanding of Ring syntax.
*   **Crucially, the Ring language itself must be uploaded to your hosting environment.**

	single: Deploying Ring CGI Applications; Creating a CGI-Compatible Ring Script
3. Creating a CGI-Compatible Ring Script
----------------------------------------

A CGI script is simpler than a full server application. It does not use ``httplib``. Instead, it follows a simple contract:

1.  Print a ``Content-Type`` header (e.g., ``Content-Type: text/html``).
2.  Print a single blank line.
3.  Print the HTML body content.
4.  Exit.

Create a file named ``hello.ring`` with the following content.

.. code-block:: ring

    # A minimal CGI script
    See "Content-Type: text/html" + nl + nl

    See "<html>"
    See "<head><title>CGI Test</title></head>"
    See "<body>"
    See "<h1>Hello from a Ring CGI Script!</h1>"
    See "<p>This page was generated by Ring running as a CGI application.</p>"
    See "</body>"
    See "</html>"

	single: Deploying Ring CGI Applications; The Universal Ring CGI Wrapper
4. The Universal Ring CGI Wrapper
---------------------------------

To make our Ring scripts work reliably and securely, we will use a "wrapper." This is a Bash script that the web server executes. Its job is to correctly prepare the environment and then run our ``.ring`` file.

This wrapper cleverly handles different hosting configurations, sets up necessary library paths, and includes crucial security checks. Create a file named ``ring.cgi`` with the content below.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    # ==============================================================================
    # Universal Ring CGI Wrapper
    #
    # A robust CGI front controller for executing .ring files on a web server.
    #
    # How it works:
    #   1. The web server (via .htaccess) calls this script for any .ring file request.
    #   2. The script determines the correct Ring installation path and web root.
    #   3. It sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so Ring's shared libraries can be found.
    #   4. It performs security checks to prevent path traversal attacks.
    #   5. It executes the requested .ring script using the Ring compiler in CGI mode.
    # ==============================================================================

    # --- Configuration ----------------------------------------------------

    # If the HOME environment variable is not set (common in some CGI environments),
    # this script attempts to deduce it from the current working directory (PWD).
    if [ -z "$HOME" ]; then
      # Guess home directory for various hosting panels.
      # Plesk: /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/cgi-bin
      # cPanel/DirectAdmin: /home/username/public_html/cgi-bin
      # KeyHelp: /home/users/username/www/cgi-bin
      if [[ "$PWD" == /var/www/vhosts/* ]]; then
        HOME_DIR_GUESS="${PWD%/httpdocs*}"
      elif [[ "$PWD" == /home/users/* ]]; then
        HOME_DIR_GUESS="${PWD%/www*}"
      elif [[ "$PWD" == /home/* ]]; then
        HOME_DIR_GUESS="${PWD%/public_html*}"
      else
        # Fallback to the current directory if no pattern matches.
        HOME_DIR_GUESS="$PWD"
      fi
      RING_DIR="$HOME_DIR_GUESS/ring"
    else
      RING_DIR="$HOME/ring"
    fi

    # Full path to the Ring executable.
    RING_EXECUTABLE="$RING_DIR/bin/ring"

    # WEB_ROOT: Absolute path to your site's document root.
    # The script will try to guess this by removing /cgi-bin from the end of the path.
    # You can override this by setting a RING_WEB_ROOT environment variable.
    WEB_ROOT_GUESS="${PWD%/cgi-bin*}"
    export RING_WEB_ROOT="${RING_WEB_ROOT:-$WEB_ROOT_GUESS}"

    # Ensure the dynamic linker can find Ring's shared libraries.
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}$RING_DIR/lib"


    # --- Main Script Logic ------------------------------------------------

    # The web server passes the full file path of the requested .ring script
    # in the PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable.
    TARGET_RING_SCRIPT="$PATH_TRANSLATED"

    # Check 1: Ensure the target script exists.
    if [ ! -f "$TARGET_RING_SCRIPT" ]; then
        echo "Content-Type: text/html"
        echo ""
        echo "<h1>404 Not Found</h1>"
        echo "<p>The requested Ring script could not be found.</p>"
        exit 0
    fi

    # Security Check: Prevent path traversal attacks.
    # Ensure the canonical path of the target script is within the web root.
    REAL_TARGET_PATH=$(realpath -s "$TARGET_RING_SCRIPT")

    if [[ "$REAL_TARGET_PATH" != "$RING_WEB_ROOT"* ]]; then
        echo "Content-Type: text/html"
        echo ""
        echo "<h1>403 Forbidden</h1>"
        echo "<p>Access to the requested resource is not allowed.</p>"
        exit 0
    fi

    # Check 2: Ensure the Ring executable is found and has execute permissions.
    if [ ! -x "$RING_EXECUTABLE" ]; then
        echo "Content-Type: text/html"
        echo ""
        echo "<h1>500 Server Configuration Error</h1>"
        echo "<p>The Ring Compiler/VM could not be found or is not executable. Check that the 'ring' folder was uploaded to your home directory.</p>"
        exit 0
    fi

    # Change to the script's directory so file operations are relative to it.
    pushd "$(dirname "$TARGET_RING_SCRIPT")" > /dev/null

    # Execute the Ring script in CGI mode.
    # The Ring script is responsible for printing all headers and content.
    "$RING_EXECUTABLE" -cgi "$TARGET_RING_SCRIPT"

    # Return to the original directory.
    popd > /dev/null

    exit 0

5. Deployment Scenarios
-----------------------

Choose the path that matches your hosting environment.

---

.. index::
	pair: Deployment Scenarios; Shared Hosting with .htaccess (Apache/LiteSpeed)
Path A: Shared Hosting with ``.htaccess`` (Apache/LiteSpeed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most common scenario. It relies on a ``.htaccess`` file to tell the web server how to handle ``.ring`` files.

.. index::
	pair: Shared Hosting; Upload the Ring Language
**Step 1: Upload the Ring Language**

1.  Download the Ring release for Linux from the official website.
2.  On your local machine, extract the ``ring`` folder from the archive.
3.  Using an SFTP client or your hosting panel's File Manager, upload the entire ``ring`` folder to your **home directory** (e.g., ``/home/youruser``). The final structure must be ``/home/youruser/ring``.

.. index::
	pair: Shared Hosting; Upload and Configure the CGI Wrapper
**Step 2: Upload and Configure the CGI Wrapper**

1.  Using the File Manager, navigate to your web root (usually ``public_html``, ``httpdocs``, or ``www``).
2.  If it doesn't exist, create a folder named ``cgi-bin``.
3.  Upload the ``ring.cgi`` script you created earlier into this ``cgi-bin`` folder.
4.  **Set its permissions to ``755``** (rwx r-x r-x). This is crucial to make it executable. You can typically do this by right-clicking the file in the File Manager and choosing "Change Permissions."

.. index::
	pair: Shared Hosting; Create the .htaccess File
**Step 3: Create the ``.htaccess`` File**

1.  In your web root (``public_html``, ``httpdocs``, etc.), create a new file named ``.htaccess``.
2.  Add the following content. This tells the web server to use our wrapper script for any file ending in ``.ring``.

    .. code-block:: htaccess

        # Allow CGI scripts to be executed from this directory.
        Options +ExecCGI

        # Define a custom handler named 'ring-script' for all .ring files.
        AddHandler ring-script .ring

        # Specify that our wrapper script should execute files for the 'ring-script' handler.
        # The path should be relative to the web root.
        Action ring-script /cgi-bin/ring.cgi

.. index::
	pair: Shared Hosting; Upload and Test Your Ring Application
**Step 4: Upload and Test Your Ring Application**

1.  Upload your ``hello.ring`` file to your web root.
2.  In your browser, navigate to ``http://your-domain.com/hello.ring``.

If everything is configured correctly, you should see the "Hello from a Ring CGI Script!" message.

	pair: Deployment Scenarios; Cloud VM with Nginx & FastCGI
Path B: Cloud VM with Nginx & FastCGI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have ``sudo`` access on a VM and use Nginx, ``fcgiwrap`` is the standard, high-performance way to run CGI scripts.

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Install Dependencies
**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

SSH into your VM and install Nginx and the FastCGI wrapper.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx fcgiwrap

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Enable and Start Services
**Step 2: Enable and Start Services**

Ensure both services start on boot and are running now.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
    sudo systemctl enable --now fcgiwrap

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Install Ring in a System Location
**Step 3: Install Ring in a System Location**

1.  Upload or move the ``ring`` folder to ``/opt/``. The final location must be ``/opt/ring``.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # If already uploaded to your home directory:
        sudo mv ~/ring /opt/

2.  Give the web server user (``www-data``) ownership and permissions.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/ring
        sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/ring

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Make the Ring Executable System-Wide
**Step 4: Make the Ring Executable System-Wide**

This allows scripts to find the ``ring`` command without a full path.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /opt/ring/bin
    sudo bash install.sh

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Create a Directly Executable Ring Script
**Step 5: Create a Directly Executable Ring Script**

For this method, your script must have a "shebang" line pointing to the system-wide ``ring`` executable. Create or edit ``hello.ring`` to look like this:

.. code-block:: ring

    #!/usr/bin/ring -cgi

    # This script is now directly executable.
    See "Content-Type: text/html" + nl + nl

    See "<html>"
    See "<body>"
    See "<h1>Hello from Nginx and FastCGI!</h1>"
    See "</body>"
    See "</html>"

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Upload Script and Set Permissions
**Step 6: Upload Script and Set Permissions**

1.  Upload ``hello.ring`` to your Nginx web root (typically ``/var/www/html``).
2.  Make the script itself executable.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/hello.ring

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Configure Nginx
**Step 7: Configure Nginx**

Edit your Nginx site configuration (e.g., ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/default``) and add a ``location`` block to handle ``.ring`` files.

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your-domain.com;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;

        # ... other configurations ...

        # Pass .ring scripts to the fcgiwrap socket for execution.
        location ~ \.ring$ {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }

.. index::
	pair: Nginx & FastCGI; Restart and Test
**Step 8: Restart and Test**

1.  Reload Nginx to apply the new configuration.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo systemctl reload nginx

2.  Navigate to ``http://your-domain.com/hello.ring``.

This method is more involved but is the standard, secure way to integrate CGI with Nginx.

6. Platform-Specific Guides for Shared Hosting
----------------------------------------------

For **Path A**, here are specific tips for popular control panels.

	pair: Platform-Specific Guides; A Crucial Note on Host-Level CGI Support
A Crucial Note on Host-Level CGI Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you begin, understand that the ``.htaccess`` method depends on your hosting provider allowing CGI execution. Our ``.htaccess`` file uses ``Options +ExecCGI``, but some hosts disable this for security.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you follow the steps for Path A and see a **"500 Internal Server Error,"** the most common cause is a server-level restriction.

**Your first step should be to contact your hosting provider's support team and ask them this specific question:**

    "Is CGI script execution enabled for my account, and am I allowed to use the ``Options +ExecCGI`` directive in my ``.htaccess`` file?"

Confirming this first can save you hours of debugging.

.. index::
	pair: Platform-Specific Guides; cPanel
cPanel
~~~~~~

*   **Tested & Confirmed:** The ``.htaccess`` method works flawlessly on cPanel, which typically runs on an Apache or LiteSpeed web server.
*   **File Uploads:** Use the **File Manager** tool. Your web root, the folder where website files are publicly accessible, is ``public_html``. This folder is located inside your home directory, which has a full path like ``/home/username/public_html/``.
*   **Permissions:** In **File Manager**, right-click on the ``ring.cgi`` file and select **Change Permissions**. Enter ``755`` and save to make the script executable. By default, files often have ``0644`` permissions and folders have ``0755``.
*   **Creating ``.htaccess``:** In **File Manager**, you can create a new file by clicking the **+ File** button. To view existing ``.htaccess`` files, which are hidden by default, go to the **Settings** menu in the top right and check the box for **Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)**.
*   **CGI Status:** CGI is generally enabled on cPanel servers. The server looks for a ``cgi-sys/defaultwebpage.cgi`` when a domain does not have a configured VirtualHost or is pointed to the wrong IP, indicating CGI is active. Including the ``Options +ExecCGI`` directive in your ``.htaccess`` file can help ensure that CGI scripts are executed in your specific directory.

.. index::
	pair: Platform-Specific Guides; Plesk
Plesk
~~~~~

*   **Tested & Confirmed:** The ``.htaccess`` method is effective on Plesk servers running Apache. If the server uses Nginx as a proxy, you must ensure Apache is also enabled and processes requests for ``.htaccess`` to work.
*   **File Uploads:** Use the **Files** or **File Manager** tab. Your web root is typically the ``httpdocs`` directory.
*   **Permissions:** In the **Files** tab, click the three-dot menu next to the ``ring.cgi`` file and choose **Change Permissions**. To make the script executable, ensure the **Execute** permission is checked for the "Owner" and "Group" users.
*   **``.htaccess`` Support:** For ``.htaccess`` files to work, go to your domain's **Apache & Nginx Settings** and ensure that Apache is enabled and that requests are not being handled exclusively by Nginx.
*   **CGI Status:** To enable CGI script execution, go to the domain's **Hosting Settings** and ensure that **CGI support** is enabled. You may also need to configure the handler in the **PHP Settings** page by adding an ``AddHandler`` directive for ``.cgi`` files in the "Additional Apache directives" section.

DirectAdmin
~~~~~~~~~~~

*   **Tested & Confirmed:** The ``.htaccess`` method works as expected, often on servers running LiteSpeed or Apache.
*   **File Uploads:** Use the **System Info & Files -> File Manager**. Your web root directory is ``public_html``.
*   **Permissions:** In the **File Manager**, hover over the ``ring.cgi`` file and select **Set Permissions** (this may also be found by right-clicking). Set the permission code to ``755`` to make it executable. By default, folders are often ``755`` and files are ``644``.

---

.. index::
	pair: Platform-Specific Guides; KeyHelp
KeyHelp
~~~~~~~

*   **Tested & Confirmed:** The ``.htaccess`` method works as described.
*   **File Uploads:** Use the **Files -> File Manager**. Your web root is typically ``/www`` inside your user's home directory (``/home/users/username/www``).
*   **Permissions:** Within the File Manager, you can change a file's permissions. Click on the file and adjust the permissions as needed (e.g., from ``0644`` to ``0755`` to make a script executable).
*   **CGI Status:** CGI is **not** enabled by default for users. The server administrator must first enable the "Perl/CGI" permission for the specific user account. Once enabled, ``.htaccess`` directives can be used to manage CGI script execution. The ``ring.cgi`` wrapper's logic should function correctly within KeyHelp's structure, provided the necessary permissions are set.

	single: Deploying Ring CGI Applications; Security Considerations
7. Security Considerations
--------------------------

*   **Error Logging:** For a production site, prevent detailed error messages from being shown to users. Modify the execution line in ``ring.cgi`` to redirect errors to a log file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # In ring.cgi, change the execution line to this:
        "$RING_EXECUTABLE" -cgi "$TARGET_RING_SCRIPT" 2>>/path/to/your/logs/ring_errors.log

    Replace the path with a directory that is **not** inside your public web root.
*   **File Permissions:** Never set permissions to ``777``. This allows anyone to modify your scripts. The ``755`` permission is correct for executable scripts.
*   **Input Validation:** Always sanitize and validate any user input (like query strings or form data) within your Ring scripts to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

8. Conclusion
-------------

You now know how to deploy Ring applications to a wide range of hosting environments using the highly compatible CGI model.

*   **Path A (Shared Hosting)** is perfect for getting started quickly on affordable hosting plans where you have limited server control.
*   **Path B (Cloud VM)** offers higher performance and a more standard setup for users who manage their own server with Nginx.

By mastering both server and CGI deployment methods, you gain the flexibility to run your Ring applications almost anywhere.
