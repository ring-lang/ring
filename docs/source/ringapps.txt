Applications developed in little hours
=================================================

Ring is a new programming language that focuses on the Natural Language Programming and Declarative Programming paradigms 
and will let you think different about programming and how to solve your problems in a better way. It's just released in 2016.01.25!  
In little days we got thousands of downloads and many developers started learning and 
using the language. Their feedback are the secret behind the language progress and success. 
They said that Ring is powerful, beautiful and easy to learn, Some of them provided good examples about what can be done using Ring in little hours. 
They are very happy with the language productivity.

FetchStockData Application
==========================

URL : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ring-lang/-fa1U_SXSjo

Author : Bert Mariani

This App is written in Ring. 

It will fetch stock data from Yahoo and draw various types of charts.
Any valid stock ticker can be entered, or selected from the drop down list - Select Symbol.

It will not guarantee that you make money in the stock market.
But it will visualize the history of the stock.

Google API Shortener Application
================================

Author : John Storm (SienSystem)

Hi everyone,

Wanted to (finally) share a first release version of a small but very nice tool 
to shorten urls using the Google shortener API.   The code is fully documented, 
maybe too documented, but, provides a good reference as to what is going on. 

You can obtain your own API key, or you can use my key to test and use the tool.  

Hope you enjoy the application.  Please feel free to test at your convenience.  

Ring is FUN!!

This project is about (Squares Puzzle) popular game that I have programmed using
ring language with its RingAllegro Library. The principle of this game is very known to all of us, 
which is moving squares to get the real full shape of the original picture.

This game could be played using mouse and keyboard as well, showing a message of congratulations at the successful solving.

Innovative
==========

The language comes with better support for Natural Language Programming and 
Declarative Programming. The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms 
with new practical techniques on the top of Object-Oriented Programming and 
Functional Programming. No need to know anything about (Compilers and Parsing). 
You get the language constructs ready for use to create domain-specific languages 
in a fraction of time.

Practical
=========

Many of the Ring libraries (StdLib, WebLib, Natural Library, Games Engine, etc.) and 
the Ring IDE (Ring Notepad, Form Designer, etc.) are written in the Ring language 
itself. Ring is ready for use in production and increase the developers productivity.
