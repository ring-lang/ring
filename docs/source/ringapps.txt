Applications developed in little hours
=================================================

Ring is a new programming language that focuses on the Natural Language Programming and Declarative Programming paradigms 
and will let you think different about programming and how to solve your problems in a better way. It's just released in 2016.01.25!  
In little days we got thousands of downloads and many developers started learning and 
using the language. Their feedback are the secret behind the language progress and success. 
They said that Ring is powerful, beautiful and easy to learn, Some of them provided good examples about what can be done using Ring in little hours. 
They are very happy with the language productivity.

	, Jamie Cooper

"I was recently considering designing my own dynamically-typed, prototypical language and then developing a means to compile it into C/C++. However, last night I was surfing the web and noticed a little-known language called "Ring" which you've recently created. I began reading the Motivation section in Wikibooks to see why the language was designed and implemented, and I was shocked to see that someone else had created a language with the same intention and need as myself. I mean, it's mind-blowing that someone would have addressed every issue I have with the currently accepted languages. Why bother with C/C++ when the syntax can be cryptic and they are largely antiquated - why should we still be dealing with header files, etc? Moreover, your comments on Java and C# being too verbose and forcing OOP onto the user is spot on as well - yet these languages are still primarily used by millions of programmers for the most mundane tasks. At this point, I'm led to believe that it's simply a matter of legacy applications that still haven't made the transition, as well as the ever-popular "Appeal to Popularity" fallacy shared by many in academia and enterprise. Then we come to languages, that are easier and much more modern, and yet even now, are being to show their age. Languages like Python which stresses whitespace and indentation, as well as (just like the formerly mentioned languages) irrelevant tokens for the conditional statements. Granted, it's not as bad as tracking down various curly braces or semi-colons, but one misstep in indentation might as well be as frustrating to track down. The same could be true of Ruby, except with Ruby, we have even odder conventions embedded into the design of the language, which I don't feel the need to address and moreover, we're left with something like Lua which is missing a great many features that the previously mentioned languages include. There are many more languages and faults with them, we could claim that PHP is nothing more than a glue for web pages and backends but with so many frameworks available now, it's falling by the wayside fast. Javascript is constantly being cloned. So, each of these general purpose languages, which we all know are mostly domain-specific and in some cases, also oriented at certain OS(C# was before 2016 and Obj-C/Swift will likely always be primarily for MacOS apps). So, then we're left with several additional options, involving everything from hybrids to other imperative-based languages like D, GoLang, Scala, Julia, etc. But finally, there's a new language called Ring - and yes, it may just end up ruling them all. It's the unicorn we've finally been waiting to arrive, that can handle multiple domains, tasks, and paradigms. I honestly can't wait to jump in and when I do I probably won't come back up anytime soon. My only apprehension is that the language may not include a library or primitive functions for math as Python and Julia do. Aside from that, if so, hopefully, I won't be having to use linear expressions as arrays (considering how intellectually lazy it is to do) and that there will be more support/tools as the community continues to grow. It's crazy to think it's only been around for a year and yet, it's already, practically a batteries-included language."

	, Gedalya (YouTube)

"Thank you Mr. Mahmoud for all the wonderful work, whenever I dive in the Source code I see the great effort, further development more excellence, God will reward you with what you wish"

	, Azzedine Ramal

"What a great joy to find this surprisingly genius language !!!. It was a total joy to go through the documentation and look at the samples in Rosetta code.
Marvelous work. I would even leave my fortune to the development of this language. Keep the good work going and wishing this language will go viral.

ps: Thanks for keeping array index to start with 1. It means a lot."

	, Nehemiah Jacob (Sydney, Australia)

"I find it very interesting. Especially the fact that it is cross platform makes it something to keep an eye on."

	, Boudewijn Lutgerink 

"The language I like the most. Efficient, simple, easy, flexible and wonderful language."
	, Roshan Ali

"I like variety. The richer the toolbox, the more appropriate the tool."
	, Jonathan Day (Quora)

"I greatly appreciated your work and congratulations on what has been achieved."
	, Umberto Meglio (Italy)

"Thanks a lot I just found Ring two days ago and I decided to learn it, it is amazing, the samples are helping a lot."
	, Zaraki Ken

"Extraordinary. well done sir"
	, RugbyLeague (CodeProject Member - United Kingdom)

"The Ring language is pleasant. You get ahead very quickly."
	, Neskuk (CodeProject Member - Switzerland)

"I'm happy to use your language."
	, Akhil Reddy

"I am enjoying using the Ring Programming language."
	, Gabriel Wendt

"I'm loving this language!"
	, Pablo Prieto

"Ring is the language that offers the greatest potential for converting programmers frustrated with the amount of time it takes to develop apps in C/C++, C#  and other OOP-based languages.

Considering the extent to which Ring has evolved since the first release in 2016, the Ring team has proven itself worthy of a very high achievement award in the world of programming languages.

The extent to which Ring has simplified the development database apps, web apps and GUI apps is a great credit to the Ring team.
Ring's implementation of OOP and GUI based apps is far superior to C++ and C# 

Another major achievement of the Ring team is the ease at which programmers can get on-line access to Ring documentation, compared to on-line C++ and C# documentation"
	, L Godioleskky

Google API Shortener Application
================================

Author : John Storm (SienSystem)

Hi everyone,

Wanted to (finally) share a first release version of a small but very nice tool 
to shorten urls using the Google shortener API.   The code is fully documented, 
maybe too documented, but, provides a good reference as to what is going on. 

You can obtain your own API key, or you can use my key to test and use the tool.  

Hope you enjoy the application.  Please feel free to test at your convenience.  

Ring is FUN!!

Innovative
==========

The language comes with better support for Natural Language Programming and 
Declarative Programming. The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms 
with new practical techniques on the top of Object-Oriented Programming and 
Functional Programming. No need to know anything about (Compilers and Parsing). 
You get the language constructs ready for use to create domain-specific languages 
in a fraction of time.
