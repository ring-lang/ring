Find in files Application
=========================

Ring 1.8 comes with Find in files application

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.8?; String2Constant Application

String2Constant Application
===========================

Ring 1.8 comes with String2Constant application

Using this tool we can convert the source code to be based on constants instead of string literals

Then we can store constants in separate source code files that we can translate to different languages

Where we can have special file for each language, like (English.ring, Arabic.ring and so on)

Using this simple tool, the Form Designer is translated to Arabic language too just as an example.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.8?; The For Loops uses the local scope

The For Loops uses the local scope
==================================

In Ring 1.8, when the For Loop defines new identifier (variable) it will define it in the local scope.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	x = 10
	? x		# Print 10
	test1()
	? x		# Print 10
	test2()
	? x		# Print 10

	func test1
		for x = 1 to 5
		next
		? x	# Print 6

	func test2
		list = 1:5
		for x in list
		next
		? x	# Print NULL (The "For In" loop will kill the reference after the loop)

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	10
	6
	10
	NULL
	10	
		
.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.8?; Merge binary characters

Merge binary characters
=======================

From Ring 1.0 we can create binary strings and do operations on these strings.

Now in Ring 1.8, we can get individual characters from these strings and merge them together using
the '+' operator.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	cStr = "Welcome"
	? cstr[1] + cstr[2] + cStr[5]
	v = cstr[1] + cstr[2] + cStr[5]
	? v
	? len(v)
	c1 = cStr[1]
	? c1
	aList = [1,2,3]
	cStr = ""
	for item in aList 
		cStr += int2bytes(item)
	next 
	? "All String"
	? len(cStr)
	? "First Part"
	n1 = cStr[1] + cStr[2] + cStr[3] + cStr[4]
	? len(n1)
	? "Second Part"
	n2 = cStr[5] + cStr[6] + cStr[7] + cStr[8]
	? len(n2)
	? "Third Part"
	n3 = cStr[9] + cStr[10] + cStr[11] + cStr[12]
	? len(n3)
	? "All String"
	cString = cStr[1] + cStr[2] + cStr[3] + cStr[4] + 
		  cStr[5] + cStr[6] + cStr[7] + cStr[8] + 
		  cStr[9] + cStr[10] + cStr[11] + cStr[12]
	? len(cString)
	? ascii(cStr[1])
	? len(cStr[2])

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Weo
	Weo
	3
	W
	All String
	12
	First Part
	4
	Second Part
	4	
	Third Part
	4
	All String
	12
	1
	1
	

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.8?; FoxRing Library

FoxRing Library
===============

Developer: Jose Rosado

A class with some of the functions I used in FoxPro\

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	Load "foxring.ring"

	mf = new frFunctions
	? mf.frAbs(-45)      
	? mf.frAbs(10-30)    
	? mf.frAbs(30-10)   

	? mf.frTransform("    Ring is a good language    ", "@! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!") 
	? mf.frAllTrim("    Ring is a good language    ", Null) 

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	45
	20
	20
	    RING IS A GOOD LANGUAGE
	Ring is a good language
