	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better RingQt

Better RingQt
=============

RingQt comes with the next updates

(1) QStackedWidget Class
(2) QCalendarWidget Class
(3) QOpenGLFunctions Class
(4) QOpenGLContext Class

.. index::

Better Ring Notepad
===================

Ring Notepad comes with the next updates

(1) Support *.cf extension


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Ring2EXE

Better Ring2EXE
===============

Ring2EXE is updated to works as expected when we don't have a C/C++ compiler

Where we can distribute applications and get (exe file and ringo file) in this case.



.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Trace Library

Better Trace Library
====================

The Trace library is updated, In the Debugger at break points we have now the "callstack" command

This command will print the functions call stack.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "tracelib.ring"

	func main
		? "Hello from main!"
		test1()

	func test1 
		? "Hello from test1!"
		test2()

	func test2 
		? "Hello from test2!"
		test3()

	func test3 
		? "Hello from test3!"
		breakpoint()

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; ringvm_give() function

ringvm_give() function
======================

Using the ringvm_give() function we can redefine the behavior of the Give command

Also we can use ring_give() to have the original behavior

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	see "Name: " give name
	see "Hello " + name

	func ringvm_give
		see "Mahmoud" + nl
		return "Mahmoud"

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Name: Mahmoud
	Hello Mahmoud

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; ringvm_see() function

ringvm_see() function
=====================

Using the ringvm_see() function we can redefine the behavior of the See command

Also we can use ring_see() to have the original behavior

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	see "Hello world" + nl
	see 123 + nl
	see ["one","two","three"]
	see new point {x=10 y=20 z=30} 

	func ringvm_see t
		ring_see("We want to print: ")
		ring_See(t)

	class point x y z

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	We want to print: Hello world
	We want to print: 123
	We want to print: one
	two
	three
	We want to print: x: 10.000000
	y: 20.000000
	z: 30.000000


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() functions

ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() functions
====================================================

Using ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() we can run Ring programs from Ring programs

But unlike ring_state_main(), Here we can control when to delete the Ring state!

This is important when we run GUI programs from GUI programs

Because they will share the GUI Library (RingQt), And In this case the caller will call

qApp.Exec()

So the sub program, will not stop and will return to the Main program

Here deleting the State of the sub programs will lead to a problem when we run the sub program events

So keeping the state is important for sub GUI programs hosted in GUI programs.

Better Documentation
====================

(1) RingQt Classes Chapter - The classes are sorted.


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Ring VM

Better Ring VM
==============

(1) Better Error Message
(2) List2Str() function support lists contains numbers
(3) Correct support for numbers contains _ as separator
(4) Creating lists without variables (statement --> Expression --> List)
(5) IsNULL() - Not case sensitive - treat Null and null like NULL
(6) Support adding the Self object to an attribute in this object
(7) Using ':' operator then keyword will create lower case literal 
(8) Printing objects - respect decimals() function
