Objects Library for RingQt Application
======================================

In this chapter we will learn about the objects library for RingQt applications.

Ring comes with the Objects library for RingQt applications. Instead of using global
variables for windows objects and connecting events to objects using the object name, the
Objects Library will manage a list of the GUI objects and will provide a more natural API to quickly
create one or many windows from the same class.

Also the Objects Library provide a way to quickly set methods
to be executed when an event is fired. Also the library provide a natural interface to
quickly use the parent or the caller windows from the child or sub windows and the other way around.

The Objects Library is designed to be used with the MVC Design Pattern.

The Objects Library uses reflection and meta-programming to add new methods to Controller classes to provide
an easy way for communication between these classes.

The Objects Library is merged in RingQt so you can use it directly when you use RingQt

	pair: Objects Library for RingQt Application; Library Usage

Library Usage
=============

* Use the openWindow(cWindowControllerClassName) function to open new Windows
* Create at least Two Classes for each window, The Controller Class and the View Class
* Create each controller class from the WindowsControllerParent Class
* Create each view class from the WindowsViewParent Class
* Use the lastWindow() function to get the object of the last window created (The Controller object).
* When you call a sub window, use the SetParentObject() method and pass the self object.
* In the View Class, To determine the event method use the Method(cMethodName) function.
* The Method(cMethodName) function determine the method in the controller class that will be executed.
* Each controller class contains by default the CloseAction() method that you can call to close the window.
* You don't need to call the Show() Method for each window, When you use openWindow() It will be called.
* In the view class, Define the GUI window object as an attribute called win.
* You can use openWindowNoShow() to avoid displaying the window.
* You can use openWindowAndLink() to quickly get methods to access the windows.

Example
=======

In the next example we will create two types of windows.

* Main Window contains a button. When the user click on the button a sub window will be opened.
* The User Can click on the button many times to open many sub windows.
* Each Sub Window contains Two buttons.
* The first button in the sub window change the Main and the Sub Windows Titles.
* The second button in the sub window close the Sub Window.

.. code-block:: ring

	load "guilib.ring"

	new qApp {
		openWindow( :MainWindowController )
		exec()
	}

	class MainWindowController from WindowsControllerParent
		oView = new MainWindowView
		func SubWindowAction
			openWindow( :SubWindowController )
			lastWindow().SetParentObject(self)

	class MainWindowView from WindowsViewParent
		win = new qWidget() {
			SetWindowTitle("Main Window")
			btnSub = new qPushButton(win) {
				setText("Sub Window")
				setClickEvent( Method( :SubWindowAction ) )
			}
			resize(400,400)
		}

	class SubWindowController from WindowsControllerParent
		oView = new SubWindowView
		func SetMainWindowTitleAction
			Parent().oView.win.SetWindowTitle("Message from the Sub Window")
			oView.win.SetWindowTitle("Click Event Done!")

	class SubWindowView from WindowsViewParent
		win = new qWidget() {
			SetWindowTitle("Sub Window")
			btnMsg = new qPushButton(win) {
				setText("Set Main Window Title")
				setClickEvent( Method( :SetMainWindowTitleAction ) )
			}
			btnClose = new qPushButton(win) {
				Move(200,0)
				setText("Close")
				setClickEvent( Method( :CloseAction ) )
			}
			resize(400,400)
		}

.. index:: 
	pair: Objects Library for RingQt Application; openWindowAndLink() Function

openWindowAndLink() Function
=============================

We can use the openWindowAndLink() function to connect between the application
windows, pass messages (call methods) between the objects. 

This function uses Meta-programming to define dynamic methods in the
Caller Class to use the dynamic objects of other windows that we create.

Example : (Uses the Form Designer)

First Window

(1) https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/applications/formdesigner/tests/twowindowspart5/firstwindowView.ring

(2) https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/applications/formdesigner/tests/twowindowspart5/firstwindowController.ring

Second Window

(1) https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/applications/formdesigner/tests/twowindowspart5/secondwindowView.ring

(2) https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/applications/formdesigner/tests/twowindowspart5/secondwindowController.ring

In the next code for example (from FirstWindowController.ring)

The openWindowAndLink() will create an object from the SecondWindowController Class

Then will add the SecondWindow() and IsSecondWindow() Methods
to the FirstWindowController Class

Also will add the FirstWindow() and IsFirstWindow() Methods
to the SecondWindowController Class

So the SendMessage() method in FirstWindowController class can
use the SecondWindow() method to access the object.

This is more simple than using lastWindow(), Parent() and
SetParentObject() methods.

.. code-block:: ring

	class firstwindowController from windowsControllerParent

	    oView = new firstwindowView

	    func OpenSecondWindow
        	openWindowAndLink(:SecondWindowController,self)

	    func SendMessage
        	if IsSecondWindow() 
	            SecondWindow().setMessage("Message from the first window")
	        ok

	    func setMessage cMessage
        	oView.Label1.setText(cMessage)

.. index:: 
	pair: Objects Library for RingQt Application; openWindowInPackages() Function

openWindowInPackages() Function
===============================

The openWindowInPackages() function is the same as openWindow()
but takes an extra list that determine the packages 
to import before opening the window.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: ring

	openWindowInPackages(cClassName,aPackagesList)

Example:

The next example from the Form Designer source code, Open the Window Flags window
using the openWindowInPackages() function.

We determine the class name "WindowFlagsController" and the packages name.

The Window Flags window uses the FormDesigner and System.GUI packages.

.. code-block:: ring

	openWindowInPackages(:WindowFlagsController,[
		"formdesigner",
		"System.GUI"
	])
