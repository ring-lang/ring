Natural Language Programming
============================

Using the Ring programming language, we can create Natural programming languages based
on classes and objects.

.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; History

History
=======

In 2010, I developed a new programming language called Supernova (developed using PWCT).
This language uses a code that looks similar to Natural Language statements to create simple GUI applications.
Now after five years, In the Ring programming language, we can get similar results, but now we have the ability 
to create/use code similar to Natural language statements in any domain that we like or need.

The Ring programming language comes with the Supernova sprite, but with more generalization and with mix of other languages
sprites.

.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Example

Example
=======

The next example presents how to create a class that define two instructions 

The first instruction is : I want window

The second instruction is : Window title = <expr>

Also keywords that can be ignored like the 'the' keyword

.. code-block:: ring

	New App 
	{
		I want window 	
		The window title = "hello world"
	}

	Class App

		# Attributes for the instruction I want window
			i want window 
			nIwantwindow = 0
		# Attributes for the instruction Window title
		# Here we don't define the window attribute again
			title 
			nWindowTitle = 0
		# Keywords to ignore, just give them any value
			the=0	

		func geti
			if nIwantwindow = 0
				nIwantwindow++
			ok

		func getwant
			if nIwantwindow = 1
				nIwantwindow++
			ok

		func getwindow
			if nIwantwindow = 2
				nIwantwindow= 0
				see "Instruction : I want window" + nl
			ok
			if nWindowTitle = 0
				nWindowTitle++
			ok
	
		func settitle cValue
			if nWindowTitle = 1
				nWindowTitle=0
				see "Instruction : Window Title = " + cValue + nl
			ok
		

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Instruction : I want window
	Instruction : Window Title = hello world


.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Change the Ring Keyword 'And'

Change the Ring Keyword 'And'
=============================

What if we want to connect between the two instructions using 'and'

We have a problem because in Ring 'and' is a keyword

We can change that using the ChangeRingKeyword command.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: ring
	
	ChangeRingKeyword  <oldkeyword>  <newkeyword>

.. note:: remember to restore the keyword again 

.. tip:: The ChangeRingKeyword command is executed in the scanner stage by the compiler (before parsing).
	
Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	ChangeRingKeyword	and  _and

	New App
	{
			I want window and the window title = "hello world"
	}

	Class App

			# Attributes for the instruction I want window
					i want window
					nIwantwindow = 0
			# Attributes for the instruction Window title
			# Here we don't define the window attribute again
					title
					nWindowTitle = 0
			# Keywords to ignore, just give them any value
					the=0  and=0

	ChangeRingKeyword	_and  and

			func geti
				if nIwantwindow = 0
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

			func getwant
				if nIwantwindow = 1
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

			func getwindow
				if nIwantwindow = 2
					nIwantwindow= 0
					see "Instruction : I want window" + nl
				ok
				if nWindowTitle = 0
					nWindowTitle++
				ok

			func settitle cValue
				if nWindowTitle = 1
					nWindowTitle=0
					see "Instruction : Window Title = " + cValue + nl
				ok

			func getand
				see "Using : and" + nl



Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Instruction : I want window
	Using : and
	Instruction : Window Title = hello world
			

.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Change the Ring Operator '+'

Change the Ring Operator '+'
============================

What if we want to define new behavior for the any operator like the "+" operator.

We can change do using the ChangeRingOperator command to hide operator (change it's name)

Then use the operator as identifier that we can handle it's behaviour

Syntax:

.. code-block:: ring
	
	ChangeRingOperator  <oldoperator>  <newoperator>

.. note:: remember to restore the operator again 

.. tip:: The ChangeRingOperator command is executed in the scanner stage by the compiler (before parsing).
	
Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	ChangeRingOperator + _+

	New App {
		+
	}

	Class App
		+ 
	        func get+
			see "Plus operator" 

	ChangeRingOperator _+ +

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Plus operator

.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Change the '=' operator to 'is'

Change the '=' operator to 'is'
===============================
	
Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	ChangeRingKeyword	and  _and
	ChangeRingOperator	=    is

	New App
	{
			I want window and the window title is "hello world"
	}

	ChangeRingOperator	is    =

	Class App

			# Attributes for the instruction I want window
					i want window
					nIwantwindow = 0
			# Attributes for the instruction Window title
			# Here we don't define the window attribute again
					title
					nWindowTitle = 0
			# Keywords to ignore, just give them any value
					the=0  and=0

	ChangeRingKeyword	_and  and

			func geti
				if nIwantwindow = 0
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

			func getwant
				if nIwantwindow = 1
					nIwantwindow++
				ok

			func getwindow
				if nIwantwindow = 2
					nIwantwindow= 0
					see "Instruction : I want window" + nl
				ok
				if nWindowTitle = 0
					nWindowTitle++
				ok

			func settitle cValue
				if nWindowTitle = 1
					nWindowTitle=0
					see "Instruction : Window Title = " + cValue + nl
				ok


.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Using Eval() with our Natural Code

Using Eval() with our Natural Code
==================================

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	func Main

	  cProgram = ' I want window and the window title is "hello world" '

	  MyLanguage(cProgram)

	Func MyLanguage cCode

	  # We add to the code the instructions that change keywords and operators 
	  # Because Eval() uses a new Compiler Object (the original keywords and operatos).
	  
	  cCode = '
		ChangeRingKeyword  and  _and
		ChangeRingOperator  =    is
	  ' + cCode

	  New App
	  {
		  eval(cCode)
	  }


	  Class App

		  # Attributes for the instruction I want window
			  i want window
			  nIwantwindow = 0
		  # Attributes for the instruction Window title
		  # Here we don't define the window attribute again
			  title
			  nWindowTitle = 0
		  # Keywords to ignore, just give them any value
			  the=0  

		  ChangeRingKeyword  and  _and
			  and=0
		  ChangeRingKeyword  _and  and

		  func geti
			if nIwantwindow = 0
			  nIwantwindow++
			ok

		  func getwant
			if nIwantwindow = 1
			  nIwantwindow++
			ok

		  func getwindow
			if nIwantwindow = 2
			  nIwantwindow= 0
			  see "Instruction : I want window" + nl
			ok
			if nWindowTitle = 0
			  nWindowTitle++
			ok

		  func settitle cValue
			if nWindowTitle = 1
			  nWindowTitle=0
			  see "Instruction : Window Title = " + cValue + nl
			ok

		
.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; BraceStart and BraceEnd Methods

BraceStart and BraceEnd Methods
===============================

We can write code that will be executed before/after using { }

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = new test {
		see "Hello" + nl
	}

	o1 {}

	class test

		func bracestart
			see "start" + nl

		func braceend
			see "end" + nl

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	start
	Hello
	end
	start
	end


.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; BraceExprEval Method

BraceExprEval Method
====================

The next example demonstrates how to use the "BraceExprEval" method to get expressions in
Natural code.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	new natural {
		create 5
	}

	class natural
		create=0
		lkeyword = false
		func braceexpreval r		
			if lkeyword lkeyword=false return ok
			see "expr eval" + nl
			see "type: " + type(r) see nl
			see "value : " see r see nl
		func getcreate
			lkeyword = true
			see "create" + nl

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	create
	expr eval
	type: NUMBER
	value : 5

.. index:: 
	pair: Natural Language Programming; Real Natual Code

Real Natural Code
=================

The next example is a more advanced example 

.. code-block:: ring

	# Natural Code
	new program {
		get 2 numbers then print the sum
	}

	# Natural Code Implementation
	class program
		# Keywords
			get=0 numbers=0 then=0 print=0 the=0 sum=0

		# Execution
		func braceexpreval x
			value = x
		func getnumbers
			for x=1 to value
				see "Enter Number ("+x+") :" give nNumber
				aNumbers + nNumber
			next
		func getsum
			nSUm = 0
			for x in aNumbers nSum+= x next
			see "The Sum : " + nSum
		private
			value=0	aNumbers=[]
		
Output: 

.. code-block:: ring

	Enter Number (1) :3
	Enter Number (2) :4
	The Sum : 7
