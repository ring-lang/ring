Why do we need Yet Another Programming Language (YAPL)?
=======================================================

The language comes with better support for Natural Language Programming and Declarative
Programming. The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms with new practical techniques
on the top of Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. Ring provide the programmers
with the tools required to build a Natural Language like Supernova or Declarative Language
like REBOL and QML without the need to know anything about (Compilers and Parsing). You get
the language constructs ready for use to create domain-specific languages in a fraction of time.

Check the Supernova programming language, In this language you can type 
(I want window and the window title is hello world.) and it will create a GUI window 
with “Hello, World!” as the window title. When i created Supernova language in 2010. I discovered
that using the Natural Code can be (Like English without limits and we can get the human 
language power in programming) but to implement that You need a new language that are 

(1) General Purpose 

(2) Practical 

(3) Can create Natural Languages very quickly. 

So we can get a System that can increase ease of use and productivity to the maximum level. 

Ring is the best language to do that. So i created Ring to achieve this goal.

Supernova was just a test for the idea. To get a near view about what are the Advantages and
Disadvantages. After testing the new ideas you provide something practical. So we have Ring 
after Supernova. A story that maybe similar to having Python after ABC. Python avoid ABC problems
but bring ABC advantages. Also Ring learn from Ruby and ROR story. The language power could
appears in Frameworks better than direct usage as a general purpose language. Also Ring comes
with a clear goal/motivation (Creating a new version of the PWCT Software) something learned
from designing the C language to create the Unix Operating System. You have a goal that direct
you in each design decision.

You will understand the value of our decisions once you start trying to solve the problem
that we will use Ring to solve. Could you enable any one in the world without knowledge 
about computer programming concepts to create very powerful software? In science the answer
is (Visual Programming) and (Natural Programming). In practical we still away from switching
to these paradigms without introducing other problems. Ring is designed to solve this problem.
It’s designed to provide Natural Programming in a practical way. And to create a powerful 
Visual Programming tool. Ring is designed to be a new world of programming after 10 years 
of research in Visual Programming and Natural Languages.

The Ring Programming Language (Compiler+VM) is developed 100% using Visual Programming without
writing a single line of code. I used my tool (Programming Without Coding Technology) to design
everything and get the C code generated for me. Advantages ? 

(1) More Faster 

(2) No Syntax Errors 

(3) Easy to understand and manage the code because the Abstraction level is more higher

(4) No Critical Disadvantages because you can control everything as writing your code.

From my experience in using Visual Programming for 10 years and Natural Programming for 5 years
I designed Ring to move the knowledge to mainstream programmers by providing a practical language 
that support these ideas.


I agree that each programmer/developer has the freedom to form his opinions about any software
including programming languages. Ring is not an exception but you may miss the idea behind the 
language. It’s innovative and may help you to think different about how to solve your problems.
Maybe this is not clear to many programmers because It’s practical language and includes many
features known to programmers and when a programmer look at a language he/she may think that 
nothing new because it’s familiar. I created Ring to solve problems in a different way. Where I
will start programming just by describing the software using new natural interfaces that i will
implement later when i move from the design stage to the implementation stage. 
(I don’t determine the time to switch between stages, You are free to use Agile methods). 
Since Ring is a new language you have 3 options. 

(1) Just don’t care.

(2) Think in the future of the language and help us if you understand the idea and want to contribute.

(3) Wait and come back again in the future to use it. 

Summary:

(A) Ring is designed based on a need to develop a new version of the PWCT software. 
Once we finish PWCT 2.0 we will have good and large software developed using Ring.

(B) We will push Declarative and Natural paradigms many steps forward. Also in next versions 
we have a plan to present a new paradigm for Network Programming and Concurrency. We tested this
new paradigm through simple prototypes during the last years and we will integrate it with Ring 
in Future releases.

(C) It’s a new language, just Ring version 1.1. A serious ecosystem comes along the way.

	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why Ring is weakly typed?

Why Ring is weakly typed?
=========================

Because it’s more Natural, and Faster and this is important for the language goals. What
comes first is what you want. When you type "Print : " + 5 , The String comes first then 5
will be converted to a String. while when you type 5 + "10" The number comes first so "10"
will be converted to 10. This help a lot to quickly convert between numbers and strings using
the same operator. If you want to prevent conversion (Write code that prevent conversion) In
these cases you will notice that what you are writing is less code (And can be removed). 

Weakly Typed = Automatic Conversion and *Automatic* is *Good Thing* and is better than *Manual*
if you know how to use it correctly.

	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What are the advantages to using Ring over native Lisp or Smalltalk?

What are the advantages to using Ring over native Lisp or Smalltalk?
====================================================================

Smalltalk and Lisp are GREAT languages. I like many of the concepts behind them but I’m sure
that selecting the right programming language is based on the problem and comes after the problem
definition. I have a problem that I want to solve and these GREAT languages are not ideal for 
this problem so I designed Ring.

When you design a new language, You can learn from the past but you must look forward and live
in the Future. What you know about Natural Programming maybe based on the *Old Knowledge* about
the power of these paradigms in the practical world and I agree with you but I see another
techniques that can be applied to get this to work in practical. What you miss about
*Natural Language* is that they are *Context Sensitive* and this means we can use it and think
different about how we can express our ideas. 

example : I want window contains 3 buttons. 

In one sentence I created 4 objects (The window and the three buttons) and added the buttons
to the window. The idea of Natural Programming is to get many things done like that.

	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why Ring is largely focussed on UI creation?

Why Ring is largely focussed on UI creation?
============================================

Yes UI creation is one of the important things in the language features because it’s designed
to create a visual programming tool, But the language is a multi-paradigm language where we can
select the programming paradigm based on the problem.


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Is Ring some sort of improvement over PHP?

Is Ring some sort of improvement over PHP?
==========================================

Ring is not designed to replace PHP, Lua and/or Smalltalk. And Ring support for Declarative
Programming and Natural Language Programming is very innovative and much better than staying 
with Procedural, Object-Oriented and Functional Languages. Ring see the future in programming
without code (Using Natural Languages) and is designed to support that.

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What are the advantages to using Ring over native C or C++?

What are the advantages to using Ring over native C or C++?
===========================================================

Ring provides a better way to mix between different programming paradigms in solving problems.

The different programming paradigms play well together in the same language. 

(1) It's easy to switch from one programming paradigm to another one because the language constructs use similar syntax for similar concepts.

(2) The paradigms are provided to interact and used together in different layers in the software. 

for example you can create a game engine using object-oriented programming but write the game code using declarative programming or natural programming and behind the scene your declarative or natural code will use the object-oriented classes.

(3) Ring is very productive and natural programming language than C/C++ languages.

(4) Ring is a dynamic language. We can generate and execute code during the runtime. We have dynamic typing and weakly typed language for flexibility.

(5) The Garbage collector is generational (escape analysis) and also use reference counting. it's very fast and still provide control to the programmer who can delete memory at any time.

(6) Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine is just 15,000 lines of ANSI C code that can be compiled and used in any platform.

(7) You can use C/C++ libraries and Ring comes with code generator to create wrappers from C functions or C++ classes. so when you need more performance or when you need to use more libraries you can easily do that.


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What is the difference between Ring and Python? And is Ring Open Source?

What is the difference between Ring and Python? And is Ring Open Source?
========================================================================

Yes the language is Free Open Source (MIT license)

In general I like Python and Ruby but i was looking for a language more suitable for creating the next version of
the Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) software so i started the Ring design.

Some simple changes that matters for my goal are 

(1) Not case sensitive

(2) The list index start from 1

(3) You can call functions before definition

(4) Don't use Python syntax like (indentation, using self, :, pass & _) 

(5) Weakly typed (convert automatically between types based on context)

(6) The programs follow simple and constant structure (Statements then functions then packages and classes)

(7) Using the '=' operator for assignment and for testing values

Critical changes are

(1) Small Language : The Ring compiler + Virtual Machine = 15K lines of C code , the other 85K lines are related to libraries and are optional when we go for using the language in C/C++ programs.

(2) The Garbage collector : Uses Escape Analysis/Reference counting and give the programmer the ability to determine when to delete memory using the assignment operator

(3) Compact Syntax : Ring is not line sensitive, you don't need to write ; or press ENTER to separate between statements

(4) Using { } to access the object then using the object attributes and methods directly

(5) Natural Programming : It's very easy to create natural interfaces using Ring based on OOP

(6) Declarative Programming using Nested Structure

The Ring programming language is designed based on my experience from using many other
languages like C, C++, C#, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, Harbour, Basic and Supernova
And the language comes with innovative features added to achieve the language goal

* Applications programming language.
* Productivity and developing high quality solutions that can scale.
* Small and fast language that can be embedded in C/C++ projects.
* Simple language that can be used in education and introducing Compiler/VM concepts.
* General-Purpose language that can be used for creating domain-specific libraries, frameworks and tools.
* Practical language designed for creating the next version of the Programming Without Coding Technology software.

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; The documentation says functional programming is supported, but then this happens?


The documentation says functional programming is supported, but then this happens?
==================================================================================

The question was about this code

.. code-block:: ring

	f = func {
	    a = 42
	    return func { return a }
	}
 
	innerF = call f()
	call innerF()

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	Using uninitialized variable : a In function _ring_anonymous_func_16601()

The Answer:

* It’s Anonymous Functions, i.e. Not Closures.

* It’s Just Ring version 1.1 (Many developers asked about supporting Closures) and during language development we may add new features that doesn’t go against the language goals or sprite.

* You can use classes and objects when you want to merge between the state and functions to provide a clear solution.

* You can use Lists and put the anonymous function inside the List then return the list that contains the state and the function. Pass the list to the function when you use it.

* You can use eval() and substr() to add the variable value directly to the anonymous function before return.

* We protect you from other scopes when you define the function. In Ring we provided the Three Scopes Rule where at each point you have only at maximum three scopes (Global, Object Scope and Local Scope).

* We don’t get everything from everywhere to be like others! We don’t need to do that. If we will think like that then we will create a very complex language or we will save our time and use other languages.

* When you think about learning or studying a new language concentrate about (What is new?) and (What is better in this language?) to know when to use it. Don’t compare a new language just released little months ago with languages started many years ago and expect to find everything that you used to have.

* Each programming language miss features in other languages. The idea is not the Features. it’s the sprite and ability behind all of the features together.

	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why the ability to define your own languages Instead of just handing over the syntax so you can parse it using whatever code you like?

Why the ability to define your own languages Instead of just handing over the syntax so you can parse it using whatever code you like?
======================================================================================================================================

It’s innovation - You create natural statements without the need to learn about parsing. 
You just use Classes which is intelligent decision (where later we can mix between classes to
 support more statements based on the context - We can change and translate the defined 
statements and many more!). Also the statements are added in Ring World where you can use
 any Ring statement.

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why you can specify the number of loops you want to break out of?

Why you can specify the number of loops you want to break out of?
=================================================================

The language support programming in the small and programming in the large. The selection
 of what features to use is based on what are you going to do. Any programmer can write 
bad code in any language if he/she wants to do that. The idea is what must be done from 
the language design to prevent errors without causing other problems like killing flexibility.

Read some source code in the Linux Kernel and Ruby Implementation for example, You will find good
 usage for GOTO as a practical example that General Rules are not for All Use Cases and great
 programmers know when to break the rules. I’m not saying go and use GOTO or saying Ring add
 things like that. But the ability to break more than one loop and/or the ability to break the
 loop from sub functions is practical for small programs.

Anyway these are some of the small new things added by the language (Not the big idea).

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why Ring uses 'See', 'Give', 'But' and 'Ok' Keywords?

Why Ring uses 'See', 'Give', 'But' and 'Ok' Keywords?
=====================================================

See and Give are selected not to be "opposite actions" but to reflect what I want to do as a programmer.

When i want to see something on the screen I use 'See'.

When i want to give some input to the program i use 'Give'.

My selection of "but" and "ok" is based on selecting keywords that can be written quickly.

Also using "but" is easy to remember than elseif/elif/elsif where each language select a different keyword.

In Ring 1.1 All of this is just an option.

You can use 'Put' and 'Get' instead of 'See' and 'Give'

You can use 'elseif' and 'end' insetad of 'But' and 'Ok'

It's your choice. In Ring we have syntax flexibility where we provide more than one style.

Also you can change the language keywords and operators.

Also you can define new natural languages too.

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Philosophy behind data types in Ring

What is the philosophy behind data types in Ring?
=================================================

The Ring programming language is designed to be SMALL. 
The language provides the basic constructs that you need to do anything!
One of the goals is to keep the basic constructs simple and small as possible.

Using Lists in Ring you can

* Create Arrays (one data type)
* Create Lists (Mix of data types)
* Create Tree (Nested arrays)
* Use String Index (Looks like Dictionary/Hash Table)

The same principle is applied to Numbers

* You can use the number for int value
* You can use the number for double value
* You can use the number for Boolean value (True/False)

The sample principle is applied for Strings

* You can use the string for storing one character 
* You can use the string for storing text (one or many lines)
* You can use the string for storing binary data
* You can use the string for storing date
* You can use the string for storing time
* You can use the string for storing NULL values (empty strings)

And we have Object Oriented Support + Operator Overloading where the programmer
can define new data types and use them as default types defined by the language

So We have

* A small and simple language that someone can pick in little days
* A fast language that provide primitive types (String – Number – List – Object)
* A flexible language that can be extended using OOP to add new types according to the application domain


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What about the Boolean values in Ring?

What about the Boolean values in Ring?
======================================


You can use true for 1 and false for 0

when you test the result of Boolean expressions in your code.

Just when you print the value using the see command you will see 1 for (true) and 0 for (false)

Why ?

Because Ring contains only 4 types of variables

(1) Number

(2) String

(3) List

(4) Object

The first type (Number) is used to represent int, double and Boolean values.

The second type (String) is used to represent char, array of characters, date and time.

The third type (List) is used to represent Arrays of one type, Arrays of more than one type, Hash (Dictionary), Tree, etc.

The object can be an object created from a Ring class (Any Class) or just a C Pointer that we get from calling a C/C++ function/method.

Why ?

The Ring is designed to give the programmer/developer the most simple constructs that can be used to do everything.
The programmer/developer can customize the language by creating new classes (and use operator overloading) to get more types that he care about according to the problem domain.

Why ?

Because simple is better, and easy to learn and remember!
And this provide flexibility to convert between high level types that can be represented using the same basic type


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Goal of including the "Main" function in Ring

What is the goal of including the "Main" function in Ring?
==========================================================

The main function is very important, you need it when you want to write statements that uses 
local variables instead of the Global scope.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	x = 10
	myfunc()
	See "X value = " + X  # here i expect that x will be (10)
        	              # but i will get another value (6) because myfunc() uses x !
	Func myfunc
	   for x = 1 to 5
	       See x + nl
	   next

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	X value = 6

Now using the Main function

.. code-block:: ring

	Func Main 
	   x = 10
	   myfunc()
	   See "X value = " + X                         

	Func myfunc
	   for x = 1 to 5
	       See x + nl
	   next

Output

.. code-block:: ring

	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	X value = 10

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; List index start from 1

Why the list index start from 1 in Ring?
========================================

It\'s about how we count in the real world, when we have three apples in our hand

we say 1 2 3 

We don\'t start from 0

The question must be why the other languages start from 0 ?

The answer is, because this is related to the machine and how we deal with values and memory address.

Example

we have array called myarray[5]

In memory : myarray will have an address

The first item will be stored in that address

The second item will come after that address and so on

Now when we need to point to the first item we need the address of myarray

So we type myarray[0] because myarray + 0 result will still point to the first item

for the second item myarray[1] because myarray + 1 result will point to the second item and so on

In Low Level languages or languages near to the machine it\'s good to be like this

But for high level language designed for applications it\'s better to be natural

Example

.. code-block:: ring

	mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
	for x = 1 to len(mylist)
		see x + nl
	next

In the previous example we start from 1 to the length of the array
if the index starts from 0 we will write

.. code-block:: ring

	for x = 0 to len(mylist)-1

or remember the for loop in other languages

.. code-block:: ring

	for(x=0 ; x<nMax ; x++ )

You will use the < operator !


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Constructor methods in Ring


Is there constructor methods in Ring?
=====================================

When you create new object for example

.. code-block:: ring

	new point

1 - Ring will allocate dynamic memory space to be used for the new object attributes that Ring doesn't know anything about them.

2 - Ring will change the current local scope and the current object scope to use the object state created in step (1)

3 - Ring will move the execution to the class Region (After the class name and before any methods)

4 - Any Instructions/Code in the class region will be executed as any Ring code

5 - Control is moved from the class region to the location of (new point) once we reach the end of the class region or we uses a Return command.

So All attributes that added to the object are dynamic attributes, this mean that you can control what attributes will be added through the runtime.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	$3D = False
	see  new point 
	$3D = True
	see new point 

	class point
		x y
		if not $3D return ok
		z

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	x: NULL
	y: NULL
	x: NULL
	y: NULL
	z: NULL

You have an option to call init() method directly when you create a new object 

This method can do anything with the object attributes as it will be called after creating the object and executing the class region code.


.. code-block:: ring

	p1 = new point3d(100,200,300)
	see p1

	class point3d
		x y z
		func init p1,p2,p3
			x=p1 y=p2 z=p3


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What happens when we create a new object?

What happens when we create a new object?
=========================================

1- When you create an object, the class region code will be executed and you will have the object attributes based on the code in that region

2- Ring don't care about the object methods until you start calling a method

3- When you call a method, Ring will check the object class and the class parent (if you are using inheritance) and will collect the methods for you to be used now or later from any object that belong to the same class.

4- Since methods are dynamic and each object get the method from the class, you can after creating objects, add new methods and use it with the object or any object created or will be created from the same class.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = new point {x=10 y=20 z=30}
	o2 = new point {x=100 y=200 z =300}

	addmethod(o1,"print", func { see x + nl + y + nl + z + nl } )

	o1.print()
	o2.print()

	class point x y z

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	10
	20
	30
	100
	200
	300

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Getter and Setter Methods

Can we use the attributes by accessing the Getter and Setter methods?
=====================================================================

Yes we can, The setter/getter methods are called automatically when you start using the attributes from outside the class
Also you can call the methods instead of using the attributes. It's your choice.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = new Developer
	o1.name = "Mahmoud"  see o1.name + nl
	o1 { name = "Gal"  see name }
	o1 { name = "Bert"  see name }

	o1.setname("Marino")
	see o1.getname()

	Class Developer

			name language = "Ring Programming Language"

			func setname value
					see "Message from SetName() Function!" + nl
					name = value + " - " + language

			func getname
					see "Message from GetName() Function!" + nl + nl
					return "Mr. " + name + nl

Output

.. code-block:: none

	Message from SetName() Function!
	Message from GetName() Function!

	Mr. Mahmoud - Ring Programming Language

	Message from SetName() Function!
	Message from GetName() Function!

	Mr. Gal - Ring Programming Language
	Message from SetName() Function!
	Message from GetName() Function!

	Mr. Bert - Ring Programming Language
	Message from SetName() Function!
	Message from GetName() Function!

	Mr. Marino - Ring Programming Language

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Search of global names while defining the class attributes

Why should a search of global names be made while defining the class attributes?
================================================================================

The question is why we don't avoid conflicts with global variable names when we
define the class attributes ?

At first remember that using the optional $ mark in the global variables names solve
the problem. Also using the Main function and avoiding global variables may help.

The Answer:

Ring is a dynamic language

We can in the run-time determine the class attributes (Add/Remove) 

We can execute (any code) while defining the class attributes

Example (1)

.. code-block:: ring

	oPerson = new Person
	Class Person
	   See "Welcome to the Ring language"

Example (2)

Customize attributes based on global variable value

.. code-block:: ring

	$debug = true
	oPerson = new Person
	see oPerson
	Class Person
	    if $debug  date=date()  time=time() ok

In the previous example when we have the $debug flag set to true, we will add the Date and Time
attributes to the object state.

Example (3)

Store the object index based on global variable

.. code-block:: ring

	$ObjectsCount = 0
	oPerson = new Person
	see oPerson
	oPerson2 = new Person
	see oPerson2
	Class Person
	      $ObjectsCount++
	      nIndex = $ObjectsCount

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	nindex: 1.000000
	nindex: 2.000000

Common Example: 

* Connect to the database then get table columns (Using global Variable/Object).

* Create class attributes based on the column names.

* Later when you modify the database - you may don't need to modify your code.

It's flexibility but remember that power comes with great responsibility.


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Conflict between Global Variables and Class Attributes


Why Ring doesn't avoid the conflict between Global Variables and Class Attributes Names?
========================================================================================

In this use case we have 

1 - Global Variable defined without a special mark like $

2 - Class contains Attributes defined using a special syntax (where we type the attribute name directly after the class)

3 - The Attributes are defined in the class region that allows writing code and using global variables

If i will accepted your proposal about changing how Ring find variables in the class region i must break one of the previous three features which will lead to more problems that are more important than this problem.

I don't like changing the feature number (1) because i would like to keep Ring code more clean and let the programmer decide when to use $ or not.

I don't like changing the feature number (2) because i like this feature and i don't like forcing the programmer to type
self.attribute 

I don't like changing the feature number (3) because it's very important in many applications to access global variables in the class region.

So what was my decision ? 

I decided to leave this case for the programmer who will decide what to do to avoid this special case

1 - The programmer can avoid using global variables (Better) and can use the Main function (Optional)

2 - The programmer can use $ before the variable name or any mark like global_ or g_

3 - The programmer can use self.attribute after the class name to define the attributes 

In general, for small programs you can use global variables and functions.
For large programs, use classes and objects and small number of global variables or avoid them at all.

How to get the file size using ftell() and fseek() functions?
=============================================================


The next function can be used to get the file size without reading the file!

.. code-block:: ring

	func getFileSize fp
	       C_FILESTART = 0
	       C_FILEEND = 2
	       fseek(fp,0,C_FILEEND)
	       nFileSize = ftell(fp)
	       fseek(fp,0,C_FILESTART)
	       return nFileSize

.. note:: The previous function take the fp (file pointer) as parameter, We can get the fp from opening the file using fopen() function.

.. code-block:: ring

	fp = fopen("filename","r")

	see  "File Size : " + getFileSize(fp) + nl

Another solution (Read the file)

.. code-block:: ring

	see len(read("filename"))


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; How to get the current source file path?

How to get the current source file path?
========================================

We can use the next function to get the current source file path
then we can add the path variable to the file name

.. code-block:: ring

	cPath = CurrentPath()
	func currentpath
		cFileName = filename()
		for x = len(cFileName) to 1 step -1
			if cFileName[x] = "/"
				return left(cFileName,x-1)
			ok
		next
		return cFileName


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; What about predefined parameters or optional parameters in functions?

What about predefined parameters or optional parameters in functions?
=====================================================================

if you want to use predefined parameters or optional parameters
Just accept a list that works like hash/dictionary

Example

.. code-block:: ring

	sum([ :a = 1, :b = 2])
	sum([ :a = 1 ])
	sum([ :b = 2 ])
	func sum pList
		if plist[:a] = NULL pList[:a] = 4 ok
		if plist[:b] = NULL pList[:b] = 5 ok
		see pList[:a] + pList[:b] + nl

Output

.. code-block:: none

	3
	6
	6


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; How to print keys or values only in List/Dictionary?

How to print keys or values only in List/Dictionary?
====================================================


If you want to print keys only or values only just select the index of the item (one or two).

Example

.. code-block:: ring


	C_COUNTRY = 1
	C_CITY = 2
	mylist = [
		:KSA = "Riyadh" ,
		:Egypt = "Cairo"
	]

	for x in mylist
		see x[C_COUNTRY] + nl
	next

	for x in mylist
		see x[C_CITY] + nl
	next

Output

.. code-block:: none

	ksa
	egypt
	Riyadh
	Cairo

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why i get a strange result when printing nl with lists?

Why i get a strange result when printing nl with lists?
=======================================================

In the next code

.. code-block:: ring

	list = 1:5        # list = [1,2,3,4,5]
	see list + nl

New Line will be added to the list then the list will be printed, the default print of the lists 
will print a newline at the end, You added new newline and You have now 2 newlines to be printed.

.. code-block:: ring	

	See <Expr>

The see command just print the final result of the expression, the expression will be evaluated as it

.. code-block:: ring

	nl = char(13) + char(10) # just a variable that you can change to anything !

The + is an operator

.. code-block:: none

	string + string ---> new string
	string + number ---> new string
	number + number ---> new number
	number + string ---> new number

list + item ---> nothing new will be created but the item will be added to the same list

Exception

number + nl —> New String

This exception is added to easily print numbers then new line.

No need for this with printing lists because after printing the last item we already get a new line.

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Could you explain the output of the StrCmp() function?

Could you explain the output of the StrCmp() function?
======================================================

At first remember that you can check strings using '=' operator directly.

.. code-block:: ring

	see strcmp("hello","hello") + nl +
	strcmp("abc","bcd") + nl +
	strcmp("bcd","abc") + nl

if the two strings are the same then it returns 0

abc and bcd aren't the same. in the second line it returns -1 and in the third line it returns 1

In the second line we compare between "abc" and "bcd"

Not equal because the first letter in "abc" = "a" 
and the first letter in "bcd" = "b"

So we have "a" != "b" and "a" < "b"

So we get output = -1

In the third line we have "bcd" and "abc"

the first letter in "bcd" is "b" and the first letter in "abc" is "a"

So we have "b" != "a" and "b" > "a"

So we get output = 1

.. note:: ASCII("a") = 97 and ASCII("b") = 98 So "a" < "b" because 97 < 98

How to use many source code files in the project?
=================================================

Example:

I have the next folder

.. code-block:: none

	C:\LRing

Contains the next files

.. code-block:: none

	C:\LRing\t1.ring
	C:\LRing\mylib.ring
	C:\LRing\libs\mylib2.ring

The file t1.ring contains the next code

.. code-block:: ring

	load "mylib.ring"
	load "libs\mylib2.ring"
	myfunc()
	test()

The file mylib.ring contains the next code

.. code-block:: ring

	func myfunc
		see "message from myfunc"+nl

The file libs\mylib2.ring contains the next code

.. code-block:: ring

	func test
		see "message from test" + nl

from the folder C:\LRing

If Ring is not added to the path you can add it or use the next command

.. code-block:: none

	set path=%path%;c:\ring\bin;

Where c:\ring is the Ring folder

Now run

.. code-block:: none

	Ring t1.ring

Output

.. code-block:: none

	message from myfunc
	message from test

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why this example use the GetChar() twice?

Why this example use the GetChar() twice?
=========================================

The GetChar() function accept one character from the keyboard buffer

In this example


.. code-block:: ring


	While True
	       	See "
        	        Main Menu
                	(1) Say Hello
	                (2) Exit
	        "
	        Option = GetChar()
        	GetChar() GetChar()  # End of line
	        # the previous two lines can be replaced with the next line
        	# Give Option

	        if Option = 1
        	        see "Enter your name : " give cName
                	see "Hello " + cName
	        else
        	        bye
	        ok
	End

We uses GetChar() Three times

The first time we get the user option

.. code-block:: ring

	Option = GetChar()
 

But in the second and the third times (We accept the new line characters from the buffer)

.. code-block:: ring

	GetChar() GetChar()  # End of line

Example : when the user select the option number 1 then press ENTER

We have Three Characters

* The first character is : Number 1
* The second character is : CHAR(13)
* The third character is : CHAR(10)

Because Windows uses CHAR(13) and CHAR(10) for each new line  ( i.e. CR+LF )


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; How to use NULL and ISNULL() function?

How to use NULL and ISNULL() function?
======================================

when we try to use uninitialized variable in the Ring programming language, we get a clear runtime error message

Example

.. code-block:: ring

	See x

Output

.. code-block:: none

	Line 1 Error (R24) : Using uninitialized variable : x
	in file tests\seeuninit.ring

The same happens when you try to access uninitialized attributes

Example

.. code-block:: ring

	o1 = new point
	see o1
	see o1.x
	class point x y z

Output

.. code-block:: none

	x: NULL
	y: NULL
	z: NULL

	Line 3 Error (R24) : Using uninitialized variable : x
	in file tests\seeuninit2.ring

if you want to check for the error, just use Try/Catch/End

.. code-block:: ring

	Try
		see x
	Catch
		See "Sorry, We can't use x!" + nl
	Done

Output

.. code-block:: none

	Sorry, We can't use x!

Now we will talk about NULL and ISNULL()

Since we get error message when we deal with uninitialized variables

We can check these errors using Try/Catch/Done, So we uses NULL and ISNULL() for dealing with Strings.

NULL is a variable contains an empty string

ISNULL() is a function that returns true (1) if the input is an empty string or just a string contains "NULL"

This because we need to test these values (empty strings) and strings contains "NULL" that sometimes come from external resource like DBMS.

Example

.. code-block:: ring

	See IsNull(5) + nl +        # print 0
	IsNull("hello") + nl +      # print 0
	IsNull([1,3,5]) + nl +      # print 0
	IsNull("") + nl +           # print 1
	IsNull("NULL")              # print 1

How to insert an item to the first position in the list?
========================================================

To insert an item we can use the insert(aList,nIndex,Value) function.

.. code-block:: ring

	aList = 1:5
	insert(aList,0,0)
	See aList # print numbers from 0 to 5


.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; How to print new lines and other characters?

How to print new lines and other characters?
============================================

To print new line we can use the nl variable.

.. code-block:: ring

	See "Hello" + nl

or we can use multi-line literal as in the next example

.. code-block:: ring

	See "Hello
	
	"
if we want to print other characters we can use the char(nASCII) function

.. code-block:: ring

	See char(109) + nl +    # print m
	    char(77)            # print M

.. index:: 
	pair: Frequently Asked Questions; Why we don't use () after the qApp class name?

Why we don't use () after the qApp class name?
==============================================

When we use RingQt to create GUI application, we uses () after the 
class name when we create new objects for example.

.. code-block:: ring

	new qWidget() { setWindowTitle("Hello World") resize(400,400) show() }

but before doing that we create an object from the qApp class and we don't use () after that

.. code-block:: ring

	Load "guilib.ring"
	app = new qApp
	{
	    win=new qWidget()
	    {
        	setwindowtitle(:test)
         	show()
	    }
	    exec()
	}
 
Using () after the class name means calling the init() method in the class and passing parameters to this method.

If we used () while no init() method in the class we get the expected error message.

The class qApp don't have this method while the other classes have it because they need it to 
create an object using a function that return a pointer to that object and this pointer will
be stored in an attribute called pObject, for more information see ring_qt.ring file
which contains the classes.


.. index::

Why the window title bar is going outside the screen?
=====================================================

When we write the next code


.. code-block:: ring

	Load "guilib.ring"
	app = new qApp

		      setGeometry(0,0,200,200)
		      show()
		}
		exec()

I would expect that the window will run at the point (0,0) with (200,200) size but the actual 
result is that the window title bar is going outside the screen.

This is related to the behavior of Qt framework.

The next code will avoid the problem

How to use SQLite using ODBC?
=============================

In Ring 1.1 we have native support for SQLite, so you don't need to use it through ODBC.

Also we can access SQLite through RingQt.

The answer to your question
