Building Games For Android
==========================

In this chapter we will learn about Building RingLibSDL Games for Mobile.

So we can create packages (*.apk) for the applications that are developed using Ring Game Engine for 2D Games.


Download Requirements and Update the Android SDK
================================================

* The Android SDK Tools

	https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

* The Android NDK 

		https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html

* Apache Ant v1.8 or later 

		http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

* Java SE Development Kit (JDK) v6 or later

		http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

* Update the Android SDK to get the API and tools packages required for development


Project Folder
==============

Open the project folder : ring/android/ringlibsdl/project

.. image:: ringlibsdlandroid_shot1.png
	:alt: RingLibSDL for Android


You can add the source code (*.ring) and Images/Sound Files to the assets folder.

.. image:: ringlibsdlandroid_shot2.png
	:alt: RingLibSDL for Android

You will find the Flappy Bird 3000 Game ready for building.

The execution starts from the start.ring file

.. code-block:: ring

	load "game2.ring"


Building the project
====================

Move to the ring/android/ringlibsdl/project folder 

We can build using the next command (We need to do this for one time only).

.. code-block:: none

	ndk-build


Then we can create the package (*.apk) using the next command.

.. code-block:: none

	ant debug
