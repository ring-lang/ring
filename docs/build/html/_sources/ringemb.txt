Embedding Ring in Ring
======================

In this chapter we will learn about embedding Ring in Ring programs and applications.

Embedding Ring in Ring without sharing the State
================================================

From Ring 1.0 we already have functions for embedding Ring in the C language. Also we
can execute Ring code inside Ring programs using the eval() function. In this release
we provide functions for embedding Ring in Ring programs without sharing the state.

Advantages:

(1) Quick integration for Ring programs and applications together without conflicts.

(2) Execute and run Ring code in safe environments that we can trace.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	pState = ring_state_init()
	ring_state_runcode(pState,"See 'Hello, World!'+nl")
	ring_state_runcode(pState,"x = 10")

	pState2 = ring_state_init()
	ring_state_runcode(pState2,"See 'Hello, World!'+nl")
	ring_state_runcode(pState2,"x = 20")

	ring_state_runcode(pState,"see x +nl")
	ring_state_runcode(pState2,"see x +nl")

	v1 = ring_state_findvar(pState,"x")
	v2 = ring_state_findvar(pState2,"x")

	see v1[3] + nl
	see V2[3] + nl

	ring_state_delete(pState)
	ring_state_delete(pState2)

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Hello, World!
	Hello, World!
	10
	20
	10
	20

Serial Execution of Programs
============================

We can execute application after another application using ring_state_main()

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	chdir(exefolder()+"/../applications/formdesigner")
	ring_state_main('formdesigner.ring')
	chdir(exefolder()+"/../applications/cards")
	ring_state_main('cards.ring')
