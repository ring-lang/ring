<div class="section" id="why-do-we-need-yet-another-programming-language-yapl">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Why do we need Yet Another Programming Language (YAPL)?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-yet-another-programming-language-yapl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The language comes with better support for natural language programming and declarative
programming. The innovation comes in supporting these paradigms with new practical techniques
on the top of object-oriented programming and functional programming. Ring provides the programmers
with the tools required to build a natural language like Supernova or a declarative language
like REBOL and QML without the need to know anything about (compilers and parsing). You get
the language constructs ready for use to create domain-specific languages in a fraction of time.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Supernova programming language, in this language you can type:
(I want window and the window title is hello world.) and it will create a GUI window
with &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; as the window title. When I created Supernova language in 2010, i discovered
that using the natural code can be (similar to English and without limits and we can use the power
of human language in programming) but to implement that you need a new language that has:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>General Purpose</li>
<li>Practical</li>
<li>Can create natural languages very quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we can get a system that can increase ease of use and productivity to the maximum level.</p>
<p>So I created Ring because it was the best way to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Supernova was just a test of the idea, it helped getting a better view of the advantages and
the disadvantages of the idea. And After testing the new ideas you are provided with something
practical. So now we have Ring after Supernova. A story that is maybe similar to having Python
after ABC.Where Python avoids the problems of ABC, but keeps the advantages of ABC. Also, Ring
learns from Ruby and ROR&#8217;s story. The language power could appear in frameworks better than the
direct usage as a general purpose language. Also Ring comes with a clear goal/motivation;
(Creating a new version of the PWCT Software) something that was learned from the design the
C language in a certain way to create the Unix Operating System. In other words, you have a
goal that directs you in each design decision.</p>
<p>You will understand the value of our decisions once you start trying to solve the problem
that we will use Ring to solve. The questions is: could you enable any one in the world
without knowledge about computer programming concepts to create very powerful software?
Scientifically the answer is (visual Programming) and (natural Programming).
In practice we are still away from switching to these paradigms without introducing
other problems. Ring is designed to solve this problem.
It is designed to provide natural programming in a practical way. And to create a powerful
visual programming tool. Ring is designed to be a new world of programming after 10 years
of research in visual programming and natural languages.</p>
<p>The Ring Programming Language (Compiler+VM) is developed 100% using visual programming without
writing a single line of code. I used my tool (Programming Without Coding Technology) to design
everything and get the C code generated for me.</p>
<p>Advantages ?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Faster</li>
<li>No Syntax Errors</li>
<li>Easy to understand and manage the code because the abstraction level is higher</li>
<li>No critical disadvantages because you can control everything as writing your code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using my experience in using visual programming for 10 years and natural programming for 5 years,
I designed Ring to move the knowledge to mainstream programmers by providing a practical language
that supports these ideas.</p>
<p>I agree that each programmer/developer has the freedom to form his opinions about any software
including programming languages. Ring is not an exception but you may miss the idea behind the
language. It is innovative and may help you to think differently about how to solve your problems.
Maybe this is not clear to many programmers because It is a practical language and includes many
features known to programmers and when a programmer looks at the language they maight think that
nothing new because it&#8217;s familiar. I created Ring to solve problems in a different way. Where I
will start programming just by describing the software using new natural interfaces that I will
implement later when I move from the design stage to the implementation stage.
(I don&#8217;t determine the time to switch between stages, You are free to use Agile methods).
Since Ring is a new language you have 3 options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To not care at all for now.</li>
<li>Think of the future of the language and help us if you understand the idea and want to contribute.</li>
<li>Wait and come back again in the future to use it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ring is designed based on a need to develop a new version of the PWCT software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we finish PWCT 2.0 we will have good and large software developed using Ring.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will push declarative and natural paradigms many steps forward. Also in next versions</li>
</ul>
<p>we have a plan to present a new paradigm for network programming and concurrency. We tested this
new paradigm through simple prototypes during the last years and we will integrate it with Ring
in future releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-ring-weakly-typed">
<span id="index-2"></span><h2>Why is Ring weakly typed?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-ring-weakly-typed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because it&#8217;s faster and more natural, and this is important for the language&#8217;s goals. One
of the rules is: the data type at the beginning affects the final result.
For example, when you type &#8220;Print : &#8221; + 5 , The String comes first, so 5
will be converted to a String. While when you type 5 + &#8220;10&#8221; The number comes first so &#8220;10&#8221;
will be converted to 10. This helps a lot to quickly convert between numbers and strings using
the same operator. If you want to prevent conversion (Write code that prevent conversion) In
these cases you will notice that what you are writing is less code (And can be removed).</p>
<p>Weakly typed = automatic conversion and <em>automatic</em> is <em>good thing</em> and is better than <em>manual</em>
if you know how to use it correctly.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-are-the-advantages-to-using-ring-over-lisp-or-smalltalk">
<span id="index-3"></span><h2>What are the advantages to using Ring over Lisp or Smalltalk?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-advantages-to-using-ring-over-lisp-or-smalltalk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Smalltalk and Lisp are GREAT languages. I like many of the concepts behind them but I&#8217;m sure
that selecting the right programming language is based on the problem and comes after the problem&#8217;s
definition. I have a problem that I want to solve and these GREAT languages are not ideal for
this problem so I designed Ring.</p>
<p>When you design a new language, You can learn from the past but you must look forward and live
in the future. What you know about natural programming maybe based on the <em>old knowledge</em> about
the power of these paradigms in the practical world and I agree with you but I see other
techniques that can be applied to get this to work in practice. What you miss about
<em>natural language</em> is that they are <em>context sensitive</em> and this means we can use it and think
differently about how we can express our ideas.</p>
<p>Example : I want window contains 3 buttons.</p>
<p>In one sentence I created 4 objects (The window and the three buttons) and added the buttons
to the window. The idea of natural programming is to get many things done like that.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-is-ring-largely-focussed-on-ui-creation">
<span id="index-4"></span><h2>Why is Ring largely focussed on UI creation?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-ring-largely-focussed-on-ui-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes UI creation is one of the important things in the language features because it is designed
to create a visual programming tool, But the language is a multi-paradigm language where we can
select the programming paradigm based on the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-ring-some-sort-of-an-improvement-of-php">
<span id="index-5"></span><h2>Is Ring some sort of an improvement of PHP?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-ring-some-sort-of-an-improvement-of-php" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ring is not designed to replace PHP, Lua or Smalltalk. Ring&#8217;s support for declarative
programming and natural language programming is very innovative and much better than staying
with procedural, object-oriented and functional languages. Ring see the future in programming
without code (using natural languages) and is designed to support that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-ring-over-native-c-or-c">
<span id="index-6"></span><h2>What are the advantages of using Ring over native C or C++?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-using-ring-over-native-c-or-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ring provides a better way to mix between different programming paradigms in solving problems.</p>
<p>The different programming paradigms play well together in the same language.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It&#8217;s easy to switch from one programming paradigm to another one because the language constructs use similar syntax for similar concepts.</li>
<li>The paradigms are provided to interact and used together in different layers in the software.</li>
</ol>
<p>for example you can create a game engine using object-oriented programming but write the game code using declarative programming or natural programming and behind the scenes your declarative or natural code will use the object-oriented classes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Ring is more productive and natural than C/C++.</li>
<li>Ring is a dynamic language. We can generate and execute code during the runtime. Ring is dynamically typed and weakly typed for flexibility.</li>
<li>The Garbage collector is generational (escape analysis) and also uses reference counting. it&#8217;s very fast and still provides control to the programmer who can delete memory at any time.</li>
<li>Ring&#8217;s compiler and virtual machine are just 20,000 lines of ANSI C code that can be compiled and used in any platform.</li>
<li>You can use C/C++ libraries and Ring comes with code generator to create wrappers from C functions or C++ classes. so when you need more performance or when you need to use more libraries you can easily do that.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-ring-and-python-and-is-ring-open-source">
<span id="index-7"></span><h2>What is the difference between Ring and Python? And is Ring Open Source?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-ring-and-python-and-is-ring-open-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes the language is Open Source (MIT license)</p>
<p>In general I like Python and Ruby but I was looking for a language more suitable for creating the next version of
the Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) software so I started the Ring design.</p>
<p>Some simple changes that matters for my goal are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Not case sensitive</li>
<li>The list index start from 1</li>
<li>You can call functions before definition</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use Python syntax like (indentation, using self, :, pass &amp; _)</li>
<li>Weakly typed (convert automatically between types based on context)</li>
<li>The programs follow simple and constant structure (Statements then functions then packages and classes)</li>
<li>Using the &#8216;=&#8217; operator for assignment and for testing values</li>
</ol>
<p>Critical changes are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Small Language : The Ring compiler + Virtual Machine = 15K lines of C code , the other 500K lines are related to libraries and are optional when we go for using the language in C/C++ programs.</li>
<li>The Garbage collector : Uses Escape Analysis/Reference counting and give the programmer the ability to determine when to delete memory using the assignment operator</li>
<li>Compact Syntax : Ring is not line sensitive, you don&#8217;t need to write ; or press ENTER to separate between statements</li>
<li>Using { } to access the object then using the object attributes and methods directly</li>
<li>Natural Programming : It&#8217;s very easy to create natural interfaces using Ring based on OOP</li>
<li>Declarative Programming using Nested Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ring programming language is designed based on my experience from using many other
languages like C, C++, C#, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, Harbour, Basic and Supernova
And the language comes with innovative features added to achieve the language goal</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Applications programming language.</li>
<li>Productivity and developing high quality solutions that can scale.</li>
<li>Small and fast language that can be embedded in C/C++ projects.</li>
<li>Simple language that can be used in education and introducing Compiler/VM concepts.</li>
<li>General-Purpose language that can be used for creating domain-specific libraries, frameworks and tools.</li>
<li>Practical language designed for creating the next version of the Programming Without Coding Technology software.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Using uninitialized variable : a In function _ring_anonymous_func_16601()
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The Answer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It&#8217;s Anonymous Functions, i.e. Not Closures.</li>
<li>Many developers asked about supporting Closures and during language development we may add new features that doesn&#8217;t go against the language goals or spirit.</li>
<li>You can use classes and objects when you want to merge between the state and functions to provide a clear solution.</li>
<li>You can use Lists and put the anonymous function inside the List then return the list that contains the state and the function. Pass the list to the function when you use it.</li>
<li>You can use eval() and substr() to add the variable value directly to the anonymous function before return.</li>
<li>We protect you from other scopes when you define the function. In Ring we provided the Three Scopes Rule where at each point you have only at maximum three scopes (Global, Object Scope and Local Scope).</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t get everything from everywhere to be like others! We don&#8217;t need to do that. If we will think like that then we will create a very complex language or we will save our time and use other languages.</li>
<li>When you think about learning or studying a new language concentrate about (What is new?) and (What is better in this language?) to know when to use it. Don&#8217;t compare a new language just released little months ago with languages started many years ago and expect to find everything that you used to have.</li>
<li>Each programming language miss features in other languages. The idea is not the Features. it&#8217;s the spirit and ability behind all of the features together.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-the-ability-to-define-your-own-languages-instead-of-just-handing-over-the-syntax-so-you-can-parse-it-using-whatever-code-you-like">
<span id="index-12"></span><h2>Why the ability to define your own languages Instead of just handing over the syntax so you can parse it using whatever code you like?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-the-ability-to-define-your-own-languages-instead-of-just-handing-over-the-syntax-so-you-can-parse-it-using-whatever-code-you-like" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s innovation - You create natural statements without the need to learn about parsing.
You just use Classes which is intelligent decision (where later we can mix between classes to
support more statements based on the context - We can change and translate the defined
statements and many more!). Also the statements are added in Ring World where you can use
any Ring statement.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-you-can-specify-the-number-of-loops-you-want-to-break-out-of">

<p>The language supports programming in the small and programming in the large. The selection
of what features to use is based on what are you going to do. Any programmer can write
poorly code in any language if he/she wants to do that. The idea is what must be done in
the language design to prevent errors without causing other problems like killing flexibility.</p>
<p>Read some source code in the Linux Kernel and Ruby Implementation for example, You will find good
usage for GOTO as a practical example that General Rules are not for All Use Cases and great
programmers know when to break the rules. I&#8217;m not saying go and use GOTO or saying Ring add
things like that. But the ability to break more than one loop and/or the ability to break the
loop from sub functions is practical for small programs.</p>
<p>Anyway these are some of the small new things added by the language (Not the big idea).</p>

<div class="section" id="why-ring-uses-see-give-but-and-ok-keywords">

<p>See and Give are selected not to be &#8220;opposite actions&#8221; but to reflect what I want to do as a programmer.</p>
<p>When I want to see something on the screen I use &#8216;See&#8217;.</p>
<p>When I want to give some input to the program I use &#8216;Give&#8217;.</p>
<p>My selection of &#8220;but&#8221; and &#8220;ok&#8221; is based on selecting keywords that can be written quickly.</p>
<p>Also using &#8220;but&#8221; is easy to remember than elseif/elif/elsif where each language select a different keyword.</p>
<p>In Ring 1.1 and later versions All of this is just an option.</p>
<p>You can use &#8216;Put&#8217; and &#8216;Get&#8217; instead of &#8216;See&#8217; and &#8216;Give&#8217;</p>
<p>You can use &#8216;elseif&#8217; and &#8216;end&#8217; insetad of &#8216;But&#8217; and &#8216;Ok&#8217;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s your choice. In Ring we have syntax flexibility where we provide more than one style.</p>
<p>Also you can change the language keywords and operators.</p>
<p>Also you can define new natural languages too.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-the-philosophy-behind-data-types-in-ring">
<span id="index-15"></span><h2>What is the philosophy behind data types in Ring?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-philosophy-behind-data-types-in-ring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Ring programming language is designed to be SMALL.
The language provides the basic constructs that you need to do anything!
One of the goals is to keep the basic constructs simple and small as possible.</p>
<p>Using Lists in Ring you can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create Arrays (one data type)</li>
<li>Create Lists (Mix of data types)</li>
<li>Create Tree (Nested arrays)</li>
<li>Use String Index (Looks like Dictionary/Hash Table)</li>
</ul>
<p>The same principle is applied to Numbers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can use the number for int value</li>
<li>You can use the number for double value</li>
<li>You can use the number for Boolean value (True/False)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sample principle is applied for Strings</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can use the string for storing one character</li>
<li>You can use the string for storing text (one or many lines)</li>
<li>You can use the string for storing binary data</li>
<li>You can use the string for storing date</li>
<li>You can use the string for storing time</li>
<li>You can use the string for storing NULL values (empty strings)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we have Object Oriented Support + Operator Overloading where the programmer
can define new data types and use them as default types defined by the language</p>
<p>So We have</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A small and simple language that someone can pick in little days</li>
<li>A fast language that provide primitive types (String - Number - List - Object)</li>
<li>A flexible language that can be extended using OOP to add new types according to the application domain</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-the-boolean-values-in-ring">
<span id="index-16"></span><h2>What about the Boolean values in Ring?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-the-boolean-values-in-ring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can use true for 1 and false for 0</p>
<p>when you test the result of Boolean expressions in your code.</p>
<p>Just when you print the value using the see command you will see 1 for (true) and 0 for (false)</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>Because Ring contains only 4 types of variables</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Number</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Object</li>
</ol>
<p>The first type (Number) is used to represent int, double and Boolean values.</p>
<p>The second type (String) is used to represent char, array of characters, date and time.</p>
<p>The third type (List) is used to represent Arrays of one type, Arrays of more than one type, Hash (Dictionary), Tree, etc.</p>
<p>The object can be an object created from a Ring class (Any Class) or just a C Pointer that we get from calling a C/C++ function/method.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>The Ring is designed to give the programmer/developer the most simple constructs that can be used to do everything.
The programmer/developer can customize the language by creating new classes (and use operator overloading) to get more types that he care about according to the problem domain.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>Because simple is better, and easy to learn and remember!
And this provide flexibility to convert between high level types that can be represented using the same basic type</p>

<p>The main function is very important, you need it when you want to write statements that uses
local variables instead of the Global scope.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="n">myfunc</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">See</span> <span class="s">&quot;X value = &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">X</span>  <span class="c"># here I expect that x will be (10)</span>
                      <span class="c"># but I will get another value (6) because myfunc() uses x !</span>
<span class="k">Func</span> <span class="n">myfunc</span>
   <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Output:</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="n">X</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>

<p>Now using the Main function</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Func</span> <span class="n">Main</span>

<span id="index-18"></span><h2>Why the list index start from 1 in Ring?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-the-list-index-start-from-1-in-ring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s about how we count in the real world, when we have three apples in our hand</p>
<p>we say 1 2 3</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t start from 0</p>
<p>The question must be why the other languages start from 0 ?</p>
<p>The answer is, because this is related to the machine and how we deal with values and memory address.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>we have array called myarray[5]</p>
<p>In memory : myarray will have an address</p>
<p>The first item will be stored in that address</p>
<p>The second item will come after that address and so on</p>
<p>Now when we need to point to the first item we need the address of myarray</p>
<p>So we type myarray[0] because myarray + 0 result will still point to the first item</p>
<p>for the second item myarray[1] because myarray + 1 result will point to the second item and so on</p>
<p>In Low Level languages or languages near to the machine it&#8217;s good to be like this</p>
<p>But for high level language designed for applications it&#8217;s better to be natural</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mylist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mylist</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">see</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">nl</span>
<span class="k">next</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the previous example we start from 1 to the length of the array
if the index starts from 0 we will write</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mylist</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or remember the for loop in other languages</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">nMax</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">)</span>

<p>When you create new object for example</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">point</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>1 - Ring will allocate dynamic memory space to be used for the new object attributes that Ring doesn&#8217;t know anything about them.</p>
<p>2 - Ring will change the current local scope and the current object scope to use the object state created in step (1)</p>
<p>3 - Ring will move the execution to the class Region (After the class name and before any methods)</p>
<p>4 - Any Instructions/Code in the class region will be executed as any Ring code</p>
<p>5 - Control is moved from the class region to the location of (new point) once we reach the end of the class region or we uses a Return command.</p>
<p>So All attributes that added to the object are dynamic attributes, this mean that you can control what attributes will be added through the runtime.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$3D = False
see  new point
$3D = True
see new point

class point
        x y

<p>1- When you create an object, the class region code will be executed and you will have the object attributes based on the code in that region</p>
<p>2- Ring don&#8217;t care about the object methods until you start calling a method</p>
<p>3- When you call a method, Ring will check the object class and the class parent (if you are using inheritance) and will collect the methods for you to be used now or later from any object that belong to the same class.</p>
<p>4- Since methods are dynamic and each object get the method from the class, you can after creating objects, add new methods and use it with the object or any object created or will be created from the same class.</p>

<p>The question is why we don&#8217;t avoid conflicts with global variable names when we
define the class attributes ?</p>
<p>At first remember that using the optional $ mark in the global variables names solve
the problem. Also using the Main function and avoiding global variables may help.</p>
<p>The Answer:</p>
<p>Ring is a dynamic language</p>
<p>We can in the run-time determine the class attributes (Add/Remove)</p>
<p>We can execute (any code) while defining the class attributes</p>
<p>Example (1)</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">oPerson</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Person</span>
<span class="k">Class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>
   <span class="k">See</span> <span class="s">&quot;Welcome to the Ring language&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Example (2)</p>
<p>Customize attributes based on global variable value</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">$</span><span class="n">debug</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="n">oPerson</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Person</span>
<span class="k">see</span> <span class="n">oPerson</span>
<span class="k">Class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">$</span><span class="n">debug</span>  <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="n">time</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">time</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">ok</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the previous example when we have the $debug flag set to true, we will add the Date and Time
attributes to the object state.</p>
<p>Example (3)</p>
<p>Store the object index based on global variable</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">$</span><span class="n">ObjectsCount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<p>Common Example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Connect to the database then get table columns (Using global Variable/Object).</li>
<li>Create class attributes based on the column names.</li>
<li>Later when you modify the database - you may don&#8217;t need to modify your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s flexibility but remember that power comes with great responsibility.</p>

<span id="index-25"></span><h2>Why Ring doesn&#8217;t avoid the conflict between Global Variables and Class Attributes Names?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-ring-doesn-t-avoid-the-conflict-between-global-variables-and-class-attributes-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this use case we have</p>
<p>1 - Global Variable defined without a special mark like $</p>
<p>2 - Class contains Attributes defined using a special syntax (where we type the attribute name directly after the class)</p>
<p>3 - The Attributes are defined in the class region that allows writing code and using global variables</p>
<p>If I will accepted your proposal about changing how Ring find variables in the class region I must break one of the previous three features which will lead to more problems that are more important than this problem.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like changing the feature number (1) because I would like to keep Ring code more clean and let the programmer decide when to use $ or not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like changing the feature number (2) because I like this feature and I don&#8217;t like forcing the programmer to type
self.attribute</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like changing the feature number (3) because it&#8217;s very important in many applications to access global variables in the class region.</p>
<p>So what was my decision ?</p>
<p>I decided to leave this case for the programmer who will decide what to do to avoid this special case</p>
<p>1 - The programmer can avoid using global variables (Better) and can use the Main function (Optional)</p>
<p>2 - The programmer can use $ before the variable name or any mark like <a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">global_</span></a> or <a href="#id25"><span class="problematic" id="id26">g_</span></a></p>
<p>3 - The programmer can use self.attribute after the class name to define the attributes</p>
<p>In general, for small programs you can use global variables and functions.
For large programs, use classes and objects and small number of global variables or avoid them at all.</p>

<p>when we try to use uninitialized variable in the Ring programming language, we get a clear runtime error message</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">See</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Output</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Line 1 Error (R24) : Using uninitialized variable : x
in file tests\seeuninit.ring
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The same happens when you try to access uninitialized attributes</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">o1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">point</span>
<span class="k">see</span> <span class="n">o1</span>
<span class="k">see</span> <span class="n">o1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">point</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">z</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Output</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>x: NULL
y: NULL
z: NULL

Line 3 Error (R24) : Using uninitialized variable : x
in file tests\seeuninit2.ring
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>if you want to check for the error, just use Try/Catch/End</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Try</span>
        <span class="k">see</span> <span class="n">x</span>
<span class="k">Catch</span>
        <span class="k">See</span> <span class="s">&quot;Sorry, We can&#39;t use x!&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">nl</span>
<span class="k">Done</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Output</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Sorry, We can&#39;t use x!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we will talk about NULL and ISNULL()</p>
<p>Since we get error message when we deal with uninitialized variables</p>
<p>We can check these errors using Try/Catch/Done, So we uses NULL and ISNULL() for dealing with Strings.</p>
<p>NULL is a variable contains an empty string</p>
<p>ISNULL() is a function that returns true (1) if the input is an empty string or just a string contains &#8220;NULL&#8221;</p>
<p>This because we need to test these values (empty strings) and strings contains &#8220;NULL&#8221; that sometimes come from external resource like DBMS.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">See</span> <span class="n">IsNull</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">nl</span> <span class="o">+</span>        <span class="c"># print 0</span>

<p>When we use RingQt to create GUI application, we uses () after the
class name when we create new objects for example.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>but before doing that we create an object from the qApp class and we don&#8217;t use () after that</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Load</span> <span class="s">&quot;guilib.ring&quot;</span>

</div>
<p>Using () after the class name means calling the init() method in the class and passing parameters to this method.</p>
<p>If we used () while no init() method in the class we get the expected error message.</p>
<p>The class qApp don&#8217;t have this method while the other classes have it because they need it to
create an object using a function that return a pointer to that object and this pointer will
be stored in an attribute called pObject, for more information see ring_qt.ring file
which contains the classes.</p>

<p>I would expect that the window will run at the point (0,0) with (200,200) size but the actual
result is that the window title bar is going outside the screen.</p>

<p>setClickEvent(cCode) take a string contains code. The code will be executed when the event happens.</p>
<p>Ring support Many Programming Paradigms like Procedural, OOP, Functional and others.</p>
<p>But when you support many paradigms at the language level you can&#8217;t know which paradigm will be used so you have two options</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Provide General Solutions that works with many programming paradigms.</li>
<li>Provide Many Specific solutions where each one match a specific paradigm.</li>
</ol>
<p>setClickEvent() and others belong to (General Solutions that works with many programming paradigms).</p>
<p>You just pass a string of code that will be executed without any care about classes and objects.</p>
<p>This code could be anything like calling a function, calling a method and setting variable value.</p>
<p>Some other languages force you to use OOP and call methods for events.
Also some other languages uses anonymous functions that may get parameters like the current object.</p>
<p>Now we have the general solution (not restricted with any paradigm), In the future we may
add specific solutions that match specific paradigms (OOP, Functional, Declarative and Natural).</p>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">test</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the previous example we have a function called test() so we can call it directly using test()</p>
<p>In the next example, test() will become a method</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">See&quot;Hello&quot;</span>
<span class="n">test</span><span class="p">()</span>    <span class="c"># runtime error message</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">test</span>
        <span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="c"># Test() now is a method (not a function)</span>
                <span class="k">see</span> <span class="s">&quot;message from the test method!&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">nl</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The errors comes when you define a method then try calling it directly as a function.</p>
<p>The previous program must be</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">See&quot;Hello&quot;</span>
<span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">}</span>   <span class="c"># now will call the method</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">test</span>
        <span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="c"># Test() now is a method (not a function)</span>
                <span class="k">see</span> <span class="s">&quot;message from the test method!&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">nl</span>

<p>Ring can work on Windows XP and load extensions without problems.</p>
<p>Just be sure that the extension can work on Windows XP and your compiler version support that (modern compilers requires some flags to support XP)</p>
<p>Check this topic
<a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2012/10/08/windows-xp-targeting-with-c-in-visual-studio-2012/">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2012/10/08/windows-xp-targeting-with-c-in-visual-studio-2012/</a></p>
<p>For example, We added</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE,&quot;5.01&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To the batch file to support Windows XP</p>

<span id="index-50"></span><h2>How to extend RingQt and add more classes?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-extend-ringqt-and-add-more-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have many options</p>
<p>In general you can extend Ring using C or C++ code</p>
<p>Ring from Ring code you can call C Functions or use C++ Classes &amp; Methods</p>
<p>This chapter in the documentation explains this part in the language
<a class="reference external" href="http://ring-lang.sourceforge.net/doc/extension.html">http://ring-lang.sourceforge.net/doc/extension.html</a></p>
<p>For example the next code in <em>.c file can be compiled to a DLL file using the Ring library (</em>.lib)</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;ring.h&quot;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="n">RING_FUNC</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ring_ringlib_dlfunc</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Message from dlfunc&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">RING_API</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">ringlib_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RingState</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">pRingState</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">ring_vm_funcregister</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;dlfunc&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">ring_ringlib_dlfunc</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then from Ring you can load the DLL file using LoadLib() function then call the C function that called dlfunc() as any Ring function.</p>
<div class="highlight-ring"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">See</span> <span class="s">&quot;Dynamic DLL&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">NL</span>
<span class="n">LoadLib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ringlib.dll&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">dlfunc</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Output</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Dynamic DLL
Message from dlfunc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you read the documentation you will know about how to get parameters like (strings, numbers, lists and objects)</p>
<p>And how to return a value (any type) from you function.</p>
<p>From experience, when we support a C library or C++ Library</p>
<p>We discovered that a lot of functions share a lot of code</p>
<p>To save our time, and to quickly generate wrappers for C/C++ Libraries to be used in Ring</p>
<p>We have this code generator</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/codegen/parsec.ring">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/codegen/parsec.ring</a></p>
<p>The code generator is just a Ring program &lt; 1200 lines of Ring code</p>
<p>The generator take as input a configuration file contains the C/C++ library information</p>
<p>like Functions Prototype, Classes and Methods, Constants, Enum, Structures and members , etc.</p>
<p>Then the generator will generate</p>
<p><a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">*</span></a>.C File for C libraries (to be able to use the library functions)</p>
<p><a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">*</span></a>.CPP File for C++ libraries (to be able to use C++ classes and methods)</p>
<p><a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">*</span></a>.Ring File (to be able to use C++ classes as Ring classes)</p>
<p><a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">*</span></a>.RH file (Constants)</p>
<p>To understand how the generator work check this extension for the Allegro game programming library</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringallegro">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringallegro</a></p>
<p>At first we have the configuration file</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/allegro.cf">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/allegro.cf</a></p>
<p>To write this file, i just used the Allegro documentation + the Ring code generator rules</p>
<p>Then after executing the generator using this batch file</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/gencode.bat">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/gencode.bat</a></p>
<p>or using this script</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/gencode.sh">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/gencode.sh</a></p>
<p>I get the generated source code file</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/ring_allegro.c">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/ring_allegro.c</a></p>
<p>The generated source code file (ring_allegro.c) is around 12,000 Lines of code (12 KLOC)</p>
<p>While the configuration file is less than 1 KLOC</p>
<p>To build the library (create the DLL files)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/buildvc.bat">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/blob/master/extensions/ringallegro/buildvc.bat</a></p>
<p>Also you can check this extension for the LibSDL Library</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringsdl">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringsdl</a></p>
<p>After this know you should know about</p>
<p>1 - Writing the configuration file</p>
<p>2 - Using the Code Generator</p>
<p>3 - Building your library/extension</p>
<p>4 - Using your library/extension from Ring code</p>
<p>Let us move now to you question about Qt</p>
<p>We have RingQt which is just an extension to ring (ringqt.dll)</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to modify Ring.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You just need to modify RingQt</li>
<li>Or extend Ring with another extension based on Qt (but the same Qt version)</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first option see the RingQt extension</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringqt">https://github.com/ring-lang/ring/tree/master/extensions/ringqt</a></p>
<p>Configuration file</p>

<p>To generate the source code</p>

<p>Study RingQt</p>
<p>Learn about the options that you have</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>wrapping a Qt class directly</li>
<li>Creating a new class then wrapping your new class</li>
</ol>
<p>For the second option (in the previous two points or in the two points before that)</p>
<p>You will create new classes in C++ code</p>
<p>Then you merge these classes to RingQt or provide special DLL for them (your decision)</p>
<p>If your work is general (will help others) just put it to RingQt.</p>
<p>if your work is special (to specific application) just put it in another extension.</p>
